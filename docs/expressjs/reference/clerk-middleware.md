# clerkMiddleware()

The `clerkMiddleware()` function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and if found, attaches the [`Auth`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md?sdk=expressjs) object to the `request` object under the `auth` key. **It must be set before any other middleware.**

> Use `clerkMiddleware()` with [`getAuth()`](https://clerk.com/docs/expressjs/reference/get-auth.md) to protect routes while keeping control over unauthenticated responses. See the [example](#example-use-clerk-middleware-and-get-auth-together).

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options))
```

## Example: Use `clerkMiddleware()` and `getAuth()` together

The following example demonstrates how to use `clerkMiddleware()` and [`getAuth()`](https://clerk.com/docs/expressjs/reference/get-auth.md) together. `clerkMiddleware()` provides authentication state to your routes, and `getAuth()` protects a route based on authentication and authorization status.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// Apply `clerkMiddleware()` to all routes
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

app.get('/path', (req, res) => {
  // Use `getAuth()` to protect a route based on authorization status
  const auth = getAuth(req)

  // Handle if the user is not authenticated
  if (!auth.isAuthenticated) {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized')
    return
  }

  // Handle if the user is authenticated but not authorized
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:example' })) {
    res.status(403).send('Forbidden')
    return
  }

  res.json(auth)
})

// This route is not protected but it will have authentication state
// attached to the request object because `clerkMiddleware()` was applied to all routes
app.get('/path2', (req, res) => {
  res.json(getAuth(req))
})

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

### `clerkMiddleware()` options

The `clerkMiddleware()` function accepts an optional object. The following options are available:

| Name                     | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Frontend API proxy

The `frontendApiProxy` option enables built-in proxying of Clerk Frontend API requests through your application. Use this when requests to Clerk's API cannot be made directly from the browser and must be routed through your server.

When enabled, requests matching the proxy path (by default, `/__clerk`) are intercepted and forwarded to [Clerk's Frontend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} before authentication runs. The `proxyUrl` used for authentication handshake is automatically derived.

> You must also [enable proxying](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/proxy-fapi.md?sdk=expressjs#enable-proxying) in the Clerk Dashboard and configure the client-side proxy URL so ClerkJS routes browser requests through your proxy.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

// Enable proxy with default path ('/__clerk')
app.use(
  clerkMiddleware({
    frontendApiProxy: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  }),
)

// Or with a custom proxy path
app.use(
  clerkMiddleware({
    frontendApiProxy: {
      enabled: true,
      path: '/custom-clerk-proxy',
    },
  }),
)
```

#### `FrontendApiProxyOptions`

| Name    | Type                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled | boolean | ((url: URL) => boolean) | Enable Frontend API proxy handling. When true, requests to the proxy path are forwarded to Clerk's Frontend API, and the proxyUrl is automatically derived for authentication handshake. |
| path?   | string                             | The path prefix for proxy requests. Defaults to '/\_\_clerk'. Must be unique and not conflict with other routes in your application.                                                     |

#### `OrganizationSyncOptions`

The `organizationSyncOptions` property on the [`clerkMiddleware()`](#clerk-middleware-options) options
object has the type `OrganizationSyncOptions`, which has the following properties:

| Name                                  | Type                                | Description |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ["/orgs/:slug", "/orgs/:slug/(.\*)"] | ["/orgs/:id", "/orgs/:id/(.\*)"]   |             |
| ["/me", "/me/(.\*)"]                 | ["/user/:any", "/user/:any/(.\*)"] |             |

### Pattern

A `Pattern` is a `string` that represents the structure of a URL path. In addition to any valid URL, it may include:

- Named path parameters prefixed with a colon (e.g., `:id`, `:slug`, `:any`).
- Wildcard token, `(.*)`, which matches the remainder of the path.

#### Examples

- `/orgs/:slug`

| URL                       | Matches | `:slug` value |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `/orgs/acmecorp`          | ✅       | `acmecorp`    |
| `/orgs`                   | ❌       | n/a           |
| `/orgs/acmecorp/settings` | ❌       | n/a           |

- `/app/:any/orgs/:id`

| URL                             | Matches | `:id` value |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `/app/petstore/orgs/org_123`    | ✅       | `org_123`   |
| `/app/dogstore/v2/orgs/org_123` | ❌       | n/a         |

- `/personal-account/(.*)`

| URL                          | Matches |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `/personal-account/settings` | ✅       |
| `/personal-account`          | ❌       |
