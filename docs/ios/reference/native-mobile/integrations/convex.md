# Integrate Convex with Clerk

**Example Repository**

- [Clerk Convex Swift](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-convex-swift)

**Before you start**

- [Set up a Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md?sdk=ios)
- [Integrate Clerk into your app](https://clerk.com/docs/ios/getting-started/quickstart.md)
- [Integrate Convex into your app](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts)

With [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), you can build a backend with a provided realtime database, file storage, text search, scheduling, and more. Paired with Clerk's authentication and user management features, you can build native mobile apps with a secure auth flow and realtime data access.

This guide shows how to integrate Convex with Clerk in your native mobile app. It assumes you have already integrated both Convex and Clerk in your app.

1. ## Set up Clerk as a Convex auth provider

   For your Clerk session token to work with Convex, you need to set up the Convex integration in Clerk.

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [Convex integration setup](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).
   2. Choose your configuration options, and then select **Activate Convex integration**. This will reveal the Frontend API URL for your Clerk instance.
   3. Save the URL. In development, its format is `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format is `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.
2. ## Map additional claims (optional)

   If you need to map additional claims, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/sessions) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

   In the **Claims** section, the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates.md?sdk=ios#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.
3. ## Configure Convex with Clerk's Frontend API URL

   1. Convex backend functions don't read your app's `.env` file. In your Convex project, run the following command to set your Clerk Frontend API URL:

      filename: terminal

      ```sh
      npx convex env set CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL '{{fapi_url}}'
      ```

      > This command needs an existing Convex deployment. If you don't have one yet, run `npx convex dev --once` to configure the project and create it, then rerun the command above.

   2. In your Convex project's `convex` folder, create an `auth.config.ts` file with the following configuration:

      filename: convex/auth.config.ts

      ```ts
      import type { AuthConfig } from 'convex/server'

      export default {
        providers: [
          {
            domain: process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL!,
            applicationID: 'convex',
          },
        ],
      } satisfies AuthConfig
      ```
4. ## Sync your auth configuration

   In your Convex project, run the following command to sync your auth configuration to your Convex backend:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex dev
   ```
5. ## Add the Clerk Convex SDK to your app

   Add `clerk-convex-swift` via Swift Package Manager to your app:

   filename: Package.swift

   ```swift
   dependencies: [
     .package(url: "https://github.com/clerk/clerk-convex-swift", from: "0.1.0")
   ]

   targets: [
     .target(
       name: "YourApp",
       dependencies: [
         .product(name: "ClerkConvex", package: "clerk-convex-swift")
       ]
     )
   ]
   ```

   Configure Clerk first with your Clerk Publishable Key, then initialize `ConvexClientWithAuth` with `ClerkConvexAuthProvider` using your Convex deployment URL. Refer to the [Convex deployment docs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings) for more info.

   filename: MyApp.swift

   ```swift
   import ClerkConvex
   import ClerkKit
   import ConvexMobile
   import SwiftUI

   @MainActor
   let client = ConvexClientWithAuth(
     deploymentUrl: "YOUR_CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL",
     authProvider: ClerkConvexAuthProvider()
   )

   @main
   struct MyApp: App {
     init() {
       Clerk.configure(publishableKey: "{{pub_key}}")
     }

     var body: some Scene {
       WindowGroup {
         ContentView()
           .environment(Clerk.shared)
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   After users authenticate with Clerk, auth state is automatically synced to Convex. Use `client` for subscriptions, mutations, actions, and auth state.
6. ## Show UI based on auth state

   Convex exposes auth state from the authenticated client. Use that state to render loading, signed-out, and signed-in UI.

   filename: ContentView\.swift

   ```swift
   import ConvexMobile
   import SwiftUI

   struct ContentView: View {
     @State private var authState: AuthState<String> = .loading

     var body: some View {
       Group {
         switch authState {
         case .loading:
           ProgressView()
         case .unauthenticated:
           Text("Unauthenticated")
         case .authenticated:
           AuthenticatedView()
         }
       }
       .task {
         for await state in client.authState.values {
           authState = state
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
7. ## Make requests and present data in the UI

   With Clerk and Convex configured, authenticated requests stay in sync so you can subscribe and render data with minimal setup.

   filename: AuthenticatedView\.swift

   ```swift
   import ConvexMobile
   import SwiftUI

   struct AuthenticatedView: View {
     @State private var messages: [Message] = []

     var body: some View {
       List(messages) { message in
         VStack(alignment: .leading) {
           Text(message.author)
           Text(message.body)
         }
       }
       .task {
         let publisher = client
           .subscribe(to: "messages:list")
           .replaceError(with: [Message]())

         for await latest in publisher.values {
           messages = latest
         }
       }
     }
   }

   struct Message: Identifiable, Codable {
     let id: String
     let author: String
     let body: String
   }
   ```
8. ## Deploy to production

   Set the Frontend API URL from your Clerk production instance on your Convex production deployment. In your Convex project, run:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex env --prod set CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL 'https://clerk.<your-domain>.com'
   ```

   Then, run the following command to sync your auth configuration to your Convex production deployment:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex deploy
   ```
