# OrganizationListView

![The OrganizationListView renders a standalone account picker for choosing between the user's Personal Account and Organization accounts.](https://clerk.com/docs/raw/_public/images/ui-components/ios-organization-list-view-v2.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '427px' } }}

The `OrganizationListView` renders a standalone account picker for choosing between the user's Personal Account and Organization accounts. It lists the Personal Account when allowed, Organization memberships, pending Organization invitations, suggested Organizations, and a **Create organization** action for users who can create Organizations.

Personal Account selection clears the Active Organization. Organization selection sets the selected Organization as **active**.

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `OrganizationListView` in your app.

### Fullscreen account picker

```swift
import ClerkKitUI
import SwiftUI

struct AccountPickerView: View {
  var body: some View {
    OrganizationListView(isDismissible: false)
  }
}
```

### Dismissible sheet

```swift
import ClerkKitUI
import SwiftUI

struct AccountPickerButton: View {
  @State private var accountPickerIsPresented = false

  var body: some View {
    Button("Switch account") {
      accountPickerIsPresented = true
    }
    .sheet(isPresented: $accountPickerIsPresented) {
      OrganizationListView()
    }
  }
}
```

### Embedded navigation

```swift
import ClerkKitUI
import SwiftUI

struct AccountPickerScreen: View {
  @State private var path = NavigationPath()

  var body: some View {
    NavigationStack(path: $path) {
      OrganizationListView(
        isDismissible: false,
        navigationPath: $path
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### Hide the Personal Account option

> When using both `hidePersonal` and `isDismissible`, place `hidePersonal` before `isDismissible` in the `OrganizationListView` initializer. Otherwise, Swift will raise an argument-order error.

```swift
OrganizationListView(hidePersonal: true)
```
