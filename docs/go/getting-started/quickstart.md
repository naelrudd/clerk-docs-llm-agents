**Before you start**

- [Set up a Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md?sdk=go)

The [Clerk Go SDK](https://clerk.com/docs/go/reference/go/overview.md) is built on top of the [Clerk Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}.

## Installation

If you're using Go Modules and have a `go.mod` file in your project's root, you can import `clerk-sdk-go` directly in your `.go` files:

```go
import (
  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
)
```

Alternatively, you can `go get` the package explicitly and it will add the necessary dependencies to your `go.mod` file:

filename: terminal
```sh
go get -u github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2
```

## Usage

For details on how to use this module, see the [Go Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2).

The Clerk Go SDK is organized using a resource-based structure similar to the [Clerk Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}. Each API supports specific operations, like `Create` or `List`. For example, the [`actortoken`](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/blob/v2/actortoken/api.go) resource supports the `Create`, `Revoke`, and `GetClient` operations. For the list of supported resources, see [`https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/tree/v2`](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/tree/v2) where almost each directory represents a resource.

To execute API operations, you must configure Clerk Go with your Clerk Secret Key.

Depending on your use case, there are two ways to use the Clerk Go SDK:

- [Without a client](https://clerk.com/docs/go/getting-started/quickstart.md#usage-without-a-client): The best option if you're using one API key.
- [With a client](https://clerk.com/docs/go/getting-started/quickstart.md#usage-with-a-client): The best option if you're using more than one API key.

For most use cases, the API **without** a client is a better choice as it requires a minimal setup and provides a more concise API for invoking operations. However, if you need to operate on multiple Clerk instances from one application, or need more flexibility for tests and mocking, you can instantiate multiple API clients with different API keys.

The following examples demonstrate both approaches.

### Usage without a client

If you only use one API key, you can import the packages required for the APIs you need. Then you can execute your desired request methods as functions, such as `$resource$.Get()` or `$resource$.Delete()`, where `$resource$` is the resource you want to interact with, such as [`user`](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/blob/v2/user/api.go).

filename: main.go
```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/user"
)

func main() {
  // Each operation requires a context.Context as the first argument
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Set the API key with your Clerk Secret Key
  clerk.SetKey("{{secret}}")

  // Create a new user
  newUser, err := user.Create(ctx, &user.CreateParams{})
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(newUser.ID)

  // Get user details
  userDetails, err := user.Get(ctx, newUser.ID)
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(userDetails.ID)

  // List users
  userList, err := user.List(ctx, &user.ListParams{})
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  for _, u := range userList.Users {
    // Process each user
    fmt.Println(u.ID)
  }

  // Delete user
  deletedResource, err := user.Delete(ctx, newUser.ID)
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(deletedResource.Deleted)
}
```

#### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the Clerk Go SDK to execute [Clerk Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} operations.

By executing the code in the snippet below, you will:

- Create an Organization and update its slug.
- Fetch all Organization memberships and loop through them to get the first one.
- Get more details about the Organization's user.

filename: main.go
```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/organization"
  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/organizationmembership"
  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/user"
)

func main() {
  // Each API operation requires a context.Context as the first argument.
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Set the API key
  clerk.SetKey("{{secret}}")

  // Create an organization
  org, err := organization.Create(ctx, &organization.CreateParams{
    Name: clerk.String("Clerk Inc"),
  })
  if err != nil {
    // You can get additional information on the error, if it can
    // be type-cast to clerk.APIErrorResponse.
    if apiErr, ok := err.(*clerk.APIErrorResponse); ok {
      fmt.Println(apiErr.TraceID)
      fmt.Println(apiErr.Error())
      fmt.Println(string(apiErr.Response.RawJSON))
    }
    // handle the error
    panic(err)
  }

  // Update the organization
  org, err = organization.Update(ctx, org.ID, &organization.UpdateParams{
    Slug: clerk.String("clerk"),
  })
  if err != nil {
    // handle the error
    panic(err)
  }

  // List the organization's memberships
  listParams := organizationmembership.ListParams{
    OrganizationID: org.ID,
  }
  listParams.Limit = clerk.Int64(10)
  memberships, err := organizationmembership.List(ctx, &listParams)
  if err != nil {
    // handle the error
    panic(err)
  }
  if memberships.TotalCount == 0 {
    return
  }
  membership := memberships.OrganizationMemberships[0]

  // Get more details about the membership's user
  usr, err := user.Get(ctx, membership.PublicUserData.UserID)
  if err != nil {
    // handle the error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(usr.ID)
}
```

### Usage with a client

If you're working with multiple keys, it's recommended to use Clerk Go with a client. The API packages for each resource export a `Client`, which supports all the API's operations. This way, you can create as many clients as needed, each with their own API key, as shown in the following example:

filename: main.go
```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
  "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/user"
)

func main() {
  // Each operation requires a context.Context as the first argument.
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Initialize a client with an API key
  config := &clerk.ClientConfig{}
  config.Key = clerk.String("{{secret}}")
  client := user.NewClient(config)

  // Create a new user
  newUser, err := client.Create(ctx, &user.CreateParams{})
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(newUser.ID)

  // Get user details
  userDetails, err := client.Get(ctx, newUser.ID)
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(userDetails.ID)

  // List users
  userList, err := client.List(ctx, &user.ListParams{})
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  for _, u := range userList.Users {
    // Process each user
    fmt.Println(u.ID)
  }

  // Delete user
  deletedResource, err := client.Delete(ctx, newUser.ID)
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(deletedResource.Deleted)
}
```
