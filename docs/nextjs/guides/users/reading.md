# Read user data

Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/nextjs/overview.md#client-side-helpers) that you can use to read user data in your Next.js application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the server and client-side to get you started.

**For AI agents:** When wiring or testing these helpers, run `npx clerk@latest users list --json` to inspect the instance's existing user data, or create a test user with `npx clerk@latest users create --email <email> --password <password> --yes` (the password is required while password authentication is enabled, the default). Install [Clerk's skills](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/ai/skills.md?sdk=nextjs) with `npx skills add clerk/skills` for correct CLI and SDK usage.

> This guide briefly touches on protecting content from unauthenticated users. For more detailed examples, see the [Protect content from unauthenticated users](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/guides/secure/protect-content.md) guide.

## Server-side

### App Router

[auth()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth.md) and [currentUser()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/nextjs/app-router/current-user.md) are App Router-specific helpers that you can use inside of your Route Handlers, Server Components, and Server Actions.

- The `auth.protect()` method can be used to perform authentication checks. See the [guide on protecting content from unauthenticated users](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/guides/secure/protect-content.md) for other methods for protecting content. You can also protect content by performing authorization checks.
- The `currentUser()` helper will return the [Backend `User`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user.md?sdk=nextjs) object of the currently active user, which includes helpful information like the user's name or email address. **It does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits.md?sdk=nextjs)** so it's recommended to use the [useUser()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/hooks/use-user.md) hook on the client side when possible and only use `currentUser()` when you specifically need user data in a server context. For more information on this helper, see the [currentUser()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/nextjs/app-router/current-user.md) reference.

The following example uses the [auth()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth.md) helper to protect the route from unauthenticated users and the `currentUser()` helper to access the Backend `User` object for the authenticated user.

> Any requests from a Client Component to a Route Handler will read the session from cookies and will not need the token sent as a Bearer token.

**Server Components**

filename: app/page.tsx
```tsx
import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Page() {
  // Use `auth.protect()` to redirect the user to the sign-in page if they are not signed in
  await auth.protect()

  // Use `currentUser()` to get the Backend `User` object
  const user = await currentUser()
  if (!user) return null

  // Use `user` to render user details or create UI elements
  return <div>Welcome, {user.firstName}!</div>
}
```

**Server Actions**

filename: app/actions.ts
```tsx
'use server'
import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  // Use `auth.protect()` to return a `401` error for unauthenticated requests
  await auth.protect()

  // Use `currentUser()` to get the Backend `User` object
  const user = await currentUser()

  // Add your Server Action logic using the `user` object
}
```

**Route Handlers**

> The [Backend `User`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user.md?sdk=nextjs) object includes a `privateMetadata` field that should not be exposed to the frontend. Avoid passing the full user object returned by `currentUser()` to the frontend. Instead, pass only the specified fields you need.

filename: app/api/user/route.ts
```tsx
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { currentUser, auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function GET() {
  // Use `auth.protect()` to return a `404` error for unauthenticated requests
  await auth.protect()

  // Use `currentUser()` to get the Backend `User` object
  const user = await currentUser()
  if (!user) return NextResponse.json(null, { status: 404 })

  // Add your Route Handler's logic with the returned `user` object

  return NextResponse.json({ userId: user.id }, { status: 200 })
}
```

### Pages Router

For Next.js applications using the Pages Router, the [getAuth()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/nextjs/pages-router/get-auth.md) helper will return the [`Auth`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md?sdk=nextjs) object of the currently active user, which contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and Organization ID, as well as the `isAuthenticated` property which can be used to protect your API routes.

In some cases, you may need the full [Backend `User`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user.md?sdk=nextjs) object of the currently active user. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server. The `clerkClient()` helper returns an instance of [`clerkClient`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md?sdk=nextjs), which exposes Clerk's Backend API resources through methods such as the [`getUser()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/user/get-user.md?sdk=nextjs){{ target: '_blank' }} method. This method returns the full `Backend User` object. **It does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits.md?sdk=nextjs)** so it's recommended to use the [useUser()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/hooks/use-user.md) hook on the client side when possible and only use `getUser()` when you specifically need user data in a server context.

In the following example, the `userId` is passed to the `getUser()` method to get the user's full `Backend User` object.

**API Route**

filename: pages/api/auth.ts
```tsx
import { getAuth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Use `getAuth()` to access `isAuthenticated` and the user's ID
  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = getAuth(req)

  // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
  }

  // Initialize `clerkClient`
  const client = await clerkClient()

  // Use the `getUser()` method to get the user's full `Backend User` object
  const user = await client.users.getUser(userId)

  return res.status(200).json({ user })
}
```

**getServerSideProps**

The `buildClerkProps()` function is used in your Next.js application's `getServerSideProps` to pass authentication state from the server to the client. It returns props that get spread into the `<ClerkProvider>` component. This enables Clerk's client-side helpers, such as `useAuth()`, to correctly determine the user's authentication status during server-side rendering.

filename: pages/example.tsx
```tsx
import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next'

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
  // Use `getAuth()` to access `isAuthenticated` and the user's ID
  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = getAuth(ctx.req)

  // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/sign-in',
        permanent: false,
      },
    }
  }

  // Initialize `clerkClient`
  const client = await clerkClient()

  // Use the `getUser()` method to get the user's full `Backend User` object
  const user = await client.users.getUser(userId)

  // Pass the `user` object to buildClerkProps()
  return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req, { user }) } }
}
```

## Client-side

### `useAuth()`

The following example demonstrates how to use the [useAuth()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/hooks/use-auth.md) hook to access the current auth state, like whether the user is signed in or not. It also includes a basic example for using the `getToken()` method to retrieve a session token for fetching data from an external resource.

filename: app/external-data/page.tsx
```tsx
'use client'

import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  const { userId, sessionId, getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth()

  const fetchExternalData = async () => {
    const token = await getToken()

    // Fetch data from an external API
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    })

    return response.json()
  }

  // Handle loading state
  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>

  // Protect the page from unauthenticated users
  if (!isSignedIn) return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello, {userId}! Your current active session is {sessionId}.
      </p>
      <button onClick={fetchExternalData}>Fetch Data</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### `useUser()`

The following example demonstrates how to use the [useUser()](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/hooks/use-user.md) hook to access the [User](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/objects/user.md) object, which contains the current user's data such as their ID.

filename: app/page.tsx
```tsx
'use client'

import { useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  const { isSignedIn, user, isLoaded } = useUser()

  // Handle loading state
  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>

  // Protect the page from unauthenticated users
  if (!isSignedIn) return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>

  return <div>Hello {user.id}!</div>
}
```
