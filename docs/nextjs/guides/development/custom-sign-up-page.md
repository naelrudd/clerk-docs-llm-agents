# Build your own sign-up page for your Next.js app with Clerk

By default, the [<SignIn />](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md) component handles signing in and signing up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [<SignUp />](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md) component to build a custom sign-up page.

To set up a single sign-in-or-up page, follow the [custom sign-in-or-up page guide](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page.md).

> If prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview.md?sdk=nextjs).

1. ## Build a sign-up page

   The following example demonstrates how to render the [<SignUp />](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md) component on a dedicated sign-up page using the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments).

   filename: app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { SignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function Page() {
     return <SignUp />
   }
   ```
2. ## Make the route public

   Ensure the `/sign-up` route is accessible to all users, including unauthenticated users.

   If your `clerkMiddleware()` includes auth checks, this pattern is no longer recommended. See [Migrating away from Middleware-based auth checks](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/upgrading/upgrade-guides/migrate-from-create-route-matcher.md?sdk=nextjs).
3. ## Update your environment variables

   - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.
   - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-up` route directly.
   - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Already have an account? Sign in' link at the bottom of the component.

   Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls.md?sdk=nextjs).

   filename: .env

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
   ```
4. ## Visit your new page

   Run your project with the following command:

   ```npm
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
