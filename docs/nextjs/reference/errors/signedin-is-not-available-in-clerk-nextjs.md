# Clerk: <SignedIn> is not available in @clerk/nextjs Core 3

Clerk: <SignedIn> is not available in @clerk/nextjs Core 3. Learn more at https://clerk.com/err/signedin-is-not-available-in-clerk-nextjs.
```

## Why this occurred

`<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>`, and `<Protect>` were removed from `@clerk/nextjs` in [Clerk Core 3](https://clerk.com/changelog/2026-03-03-core-3.md), a major release published on March 3, 2026. All three were replaced by a single [<Show>](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/control/show.md) component that handles both authentication and authorization checks through its `when` prop.

The removed components are still exported so that upgrading doesn't fail with an opaque `undefined is not a component` error. Rendering one throws this error instead, with a link to the migration steps.

If you're using an agent, its Clerk knowledge is likely out of date. Before changing this code or implementing any other `@clerk/nextjs` features, read the [Core 3 changelog](https://clerk.com/changelog/2026-03-03-core-3.md), the [Core 3 upgrade guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/upgrading/upgrade-guides/core-3.md?sdk=nextjs), and the [<Show> component docs](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/control/show.md).

## Ways to fix this

### Migrate with an agent (recommended)

Copy the prompt above and give it to your agent. It walks through installing the [Clerk CLI](https://clerk.com/docs/cli.md?sdk=nextjs) and [Clerk Skills](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/ai/skills.md?sdk=nextjs). These give your agent current, version-accurate Clerk guidance instead of pre-Core 3 training data. The prompt then applies the replacements below across your codebase.

### Replace `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>`

Remove `SignedIn` and `SignedOut` from the `@clerk/nextjs` import, import `Show` instead, and pass `when="signed-in"` or `when="signed-out"`.

filename: app/page.tsx
```tsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Show } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>Signed in content</SignedIn>
      <Show when="signed-in">Signed in content</Show>
      <SignedOut>Signed out content</SignedOut>
      <Show when="signed-out">Signed out content</Show>
    </>
  )
}
```

`<Show>` also accepts a `fallback` prop that renders when the `when` condition fails — for example, `<Show when="signed-in" fallback={...}>` renders the fallback to signed-out users.

### Replace `<Protect>`

Each `<Protect>` prop becomes a value passed to `<Show>`'s `when` prop:

| Before                                      | After                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Protect>` (no props)                      | `<Show when="signed-in">`                            |
| `<Protect role="admin">`                    | `<Show when={{ role: 'admin' }}>`                    |
| `<Protect permission="org:billing:manage">` | `<Show when={{ permission: 'org:billing:manage' }}>` |
| `<Protect feature="widgets">`               | `<Show when={{ feature: 'widgets' }}>`               |
| `<Protect plan="pro">`                      | `<Show when={{ plan: 'pro' }}>`                      |
| `<Protect condition={(has) => expr}>`       | `<Show when={(has) => expr}>`                        |

filename: app/admin/page.tsx
```tsx
import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Show } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Protect condition={(has) => has({ role: 'org:admin' })}>Admin content</Protect>
    <Show when={(has) => has({ role: 'org:admin' })}>Admin content</Show>
  )
}
```

> Like `<Protect>`, `<Show>` only **visually hides** its children — they're still present in the browser's source. Perform [authorization checks](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks.md?sdk=nextjs) on the server before sending sensitive data to the client.

## Verify the fix

1. Search your codebase for remaining usages:

   ```bash
   grep -rn --exclude-dir=node_modules "SignedIn|SignedOut|Protect" .
   ```

   Check aliased imports (`import { SignedIn as Auth }`) and re-exports too — a plain name search misses them.

2. Confirm no `@clerk/nextjs` import still pulls in `SignedIn`, `SignedOut`, or `Protect`.

3. Run your app and load a page that previously rendered one of these components. The error no longer appears, and content renders for the correct auth state.
