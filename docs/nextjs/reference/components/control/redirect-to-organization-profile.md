# <RedirectToOrganizationProfile /> (deprecated)

> This feature is deprecated. Please use the [redirectToOrganizationProfile() method](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/objects/clerk.md#redirect-to-organization-profile) instead.

The `<RedirectToOrganizationProfile />` component will navigate to the Organization profile URL which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

## Example

filename: app/page.tsx
```tsx
import { Show, RedirectToOrganizationProfile } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Show when="signed-in">
        <RedirectToOrganizationProfile />
      </Show>
      <Show when="signed-out">You need to sign in to view your Organization profile.</Show>
    </>
  )
}
```
