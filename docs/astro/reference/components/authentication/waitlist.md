# <Waitlist /> component

The `<Waitlist />` component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app. Users receive an email confirming their request to join the waitlist. Once [approved](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access.md?sdk=astro#manage-users-on-your-waitlist), users receive an email with instructions on how to join your app.

Learn more about [using and customizing **Waitlist** mode](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access.md?sdk=astro#waitlist).

## Enable Waitlist mode

Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must enable **Waitlist** mode in the Clerk Dashboard.

In [**Waitlist** mode](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access.md?sdk=astro#waitlist), users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. Existing users and users who have been approved from the waitlist will be able to sign in to your app, while new users will need to join the waitlist to access your app. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch.

> [**Email** must be enabled in the Clerk Dashboard](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md?sdk=astro#email) to allow waitlist invitation emails to be sent to users after they are approved. Support for sending waitlist invitations when **Email** is disabled is actively being worked on.

To enable **Waitlist** mode:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Waitlist**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/waitlist) page.
2. Toggle on **Enable waitlist** and select **Save**.

## Example

> Hosting the `<Waitlist />` component on a custom route requires additional setup. See the [guide on building a custom waitlist page](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/waitlist.md) for instructions.

The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

filename: pages/waitlist.astro
```astro
---
import { Waitlist as WaitlistAstro } from '@clerk/astro/components'
---

<WaitlistAstro />
```
