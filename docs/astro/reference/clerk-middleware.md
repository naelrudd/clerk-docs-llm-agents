# clerkMiddleware() | Astro

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Astro application through middleware.

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

Create a `middleware.ts` file inside your `src/` directory.

filename: src/middleware.ts
```ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/astro/server'

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware()
```

## `createRouteMatcher()` (Removed)

> **Removed:** `createRouteMatcher()` was removed in `@clerk/astro` v4. Middleware-based auth checks rely on path matching, which can diverge from how Astro routes requests and leave protected resources reachable. Move auth checks into each Astro page, API route, or server-side handler that accesses protected data, as shown below.

`createRouteMatcher()` was a Clerk helper function that accepted an array of routes and checked if the route the user was trying to visit matched one of them, so that auth checks could run in the middleware for matching routes:

filename: src/middleware.ts
```ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, redirectToSignIn } = auth()

  if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute(context.request)) {
    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
})
```

To migrate, move the auth check into each resource the matcher protected. Keep `clerkMiddleware()` itself; it's still required for Clerk to work. Role and Permission checks with [`has()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md?sdk=astro#has) also move onto the resource. Middleware logic unrelated to auth protection, such as locale redirects or headers, can stay, using plain `URL` or pathname checks.

**Astro page**

filename: src/pages/dashboard.astro
```astro
---
const { isAuthenticated, redirectToSignIn } = Astro.locals.auth()

if (!isAuthenticated) return redirectToSignIn()
---

<h1>Dashboard</h1>
```

**API route**

filename: src/pages/api/data.ts
```ts
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro'

export const GET: APIRoute = ({ locals }) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = locals.auth()

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  return Response.json({ userId })
}
```

For more resource-based protection patterns, including a reusable `requireAuth()` helper, see [Read user data](https://clerk.com/docs/astro/guides/users/reading.md).

If you want to hand this migration to a coding agent, use the following prompt:

```md
Migrate my Astro project away from Clerk's removed `createRouteMatcher` API.

1. Open `src/middleware.ts` (or `src/middleware.js`) and find every matcher created
   with `createRouteMatcher` from `@clerk/astro/server`, along with the middleware
   logic that uses it (returning 401s, calling `auth().redirectToSignIn()`, etc.).
2. For every route those matchers protected, move the auth check into the resource itself.
   If a matcher was used inverted (e.g. `if (!isPublicRoute(request))`), the protected
   set is every route it does not match, so every non-public resource needs a check:
   - In `.astro` pages, add this to the frontmatter:
     const { isAuthenticated, redirectToSignIn } = Astro.locals.auth();
     if (!isAuthenticated) return redirectToSignIn();
   - In API routes and server handlers, add this at the top of the handler:
     const { isAuthenticated } = locals.auth();
     if (!isAuthenticated) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
   - Keep any role or permission checks (`auth().has(...)`) with the resource as well.
3. Remove the `createRouteMatcher` import and calls from the middleware. Keep
   `clerkMiddleware()` itself. Middleware logic unrelated to auth protection
   (locale redirects, headers, etc.) may stay, using plain `URL`/pathname checks.
4. Ensure every page and endpoint previously covered by a matcher pattern
   (including glob patterns like `/dashboard(.*)`) now has its own check, then
   verify the project builds.

```

## `clerkMiddleware()` options

The `clerkMiddleware()` function accepts an optional object. The following options are available:
