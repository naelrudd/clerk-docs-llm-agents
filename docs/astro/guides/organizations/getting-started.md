# Get started with Organizations

**Before you start**

- [Follow the quickstart guide.](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart.md?sdk=astro)

Organizations let you group users with Roles and Permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts. This guide will demonstrate how to add Organizations, create and switch Organizations, and protect routes by Organization and Roles.

1. ## Add `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to your app

   The [<OrganizationSwitcher />](https://clerk.com/docs/astro/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher.md) component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage Organizations. It's recommended to place it in your app's header or navigation so it's always accessible to your users. For example:

   filename: src/layouts/Layout.astro

   ```astro
     ---
     import {
       Show,
       UserButton,
       SignInButton,
   +   OrganizationSwitcher,
     } from '@clerk/astro/components'
     ---

     <!doctype html>
     <html lang="en">
       <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8" />
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
         <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
         <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
         <title>Astro Basics</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <header>
   +       <OrganizationSwitcher />
           <Show when="signed-out">
             <SignInButton mode="modal" />
           </Show>
           <Show when="signed-in">
             <UserButton />
           </Show>
         </header>
         <slot />
       </body>
     </html>

     <style>
       html,
       body {
         margin: 0;
         width: 100%;
         height: 100%;
       }
     </style>
   ```
2. ## Access Organization data

   **Server-side**

   To access information about the currently Active Organization on the server-side, use [`clerkClient()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md?sdk=astro) to call the [`getOrganization()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization.md?sdk=astro) method, which returns the Backend [`Organization`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization.md?sdk=astro) object. You'll need to pass an `orgId`, which you can access from the [`Auth`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md?sdk=astro) object.

   filename: src/pages/index.astro

   ```astro
   ---
   import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'
   import { Show } from '@clerk/astro/components'
   import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/astro/server'

   // Use the `locals.auth()` local to access the `Auth` object
   // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object
   const { isAuthenticated, orgId, orgRole } = Astro.locals.auth()

   let organization = null

   // Check if the user is authenticated and has an Active Organization
   if (isAuthenticated && orgId) {
     organization = await clerkClient(Astro).organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })
   }
   ---

   <Layout title="Clerk + Astro">
     <Show when="signed-out">
       <p>Sign in to try Clerk out!</p>
     </Show>
     <Show when="signed-in">
       {
         organization && (
           <div class="p-8">
             <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
               Welcome to the <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization
             </h1>
             <p class="mb-6">
               Your Role in this Organization: <strong>{orgRole}</strong>
             </p>
           </div>
         )
       }
     </Show>
   </Layout>
   ```

   **Client-side**

   To access information about the currently Active Organization on the client-side, use the [$organizationStore](https://clerk.com/docs/astro/reference/astro/client-side-helpers/organization-store.md) store, which returns the [Organization](https://clerk.com/docs/astro/reference/objects/organization.md) object. This requires that you've [set up your Astro app to be integrated with React](https://clerk.com/docs/astro/reference/astro/react.md).

   filename: components/Home.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react'
   import { $organizationStore } from '@clerk/astro/client'

   export default function Home() {
     const organization = useStore($organizationStore)

     // Handle loading state
     if (organization === undefined) return <p>Loading...</p>

     // Handle no Active Organization state
     if (organization === null) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

     return <p>This current Organization is {organization.name}</p>
   }
   ```
3. ## Visit your app

   Run your project with the following command:

   ```npm
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit your app locally at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

   When you visit your app, Clerk will prompt you to enable Organizations.
4. ### Enable Organizations

   When prompted, select **Enable Organizations**. Choose to make membership required.
5. ### Create first user and Organization

   You must sign in to use Organizations. When prompted, select **Sign in to continue**. Then, authenticate to create your first user.

   Since you chose to make membership required when you enabled Organizations, every user must be in at least one Organization. Clerk will prompt you to create an Organization for your user.
6. ## Create and switch Organizations

   At this point, Clerk should have redirected you to a page with the [<OrganizationSwitcher />](https://clerk.com/docs/astro/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher.md) component. This component allows you to create, switch between, and manage Organizations.

   1. Select the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component, then **Create an organization**.
   2. Enter `Acme Corp` as the Organization name.
   3. Invite users to your Organization and select their Role.
7. ## Protect routes by Organization and Roles

   You can protect content and even entire routes based on Organization membership, Roles, and Permissions by performing authorization checks.

   In the following example, the page is protected from unauthenticated users, users that don't have the `org:admin` Role, and users that are not in the `Acme Corp` Organization. It uses the [`has()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md?sdk=astro#has) helper to perform the authorization check for the `org:admin` Role.

   **Server-side**

   filename: src/pages/protected.astro

   ```astro
   ---
   import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'
   import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/astro/server'

   // Use the `locals.auth()` local to access the `Auth` object
   // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object
   const { isAuthenticated, has, orgId } = Astro.locals.auth()

   const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

   // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
   const isAdmin = has({ role: 'org:admin' })

   // Use the `getOrganization()` method to get the Backend `Organization` object,
   // but only once every access check has passed
   let organization = null
   if (isAuthenticated && orgId && isAdmin) {
     organization = await clerkClient(Astro).organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })
   }
   ---

   <Layout title="Protected Page">
     {
       /* Show the appropriate message based on the user's authentication, Active Organization, and Role */
       !isAuthenticated ? (
         <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>
       ) : !orgId ? (
         <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>
       ) : !isAdmin ? (
         <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>
       ) : organization.name !== requiredOrgName ? (
         <p>
           This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization. Switch
           to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
         </p>
       ) : (
         <p>
           You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
           <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
         </p>
       )
     }
   </Layout>
   ```

   **Client-side**

   filename: components/Home.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react'
   import { $organizationStore } from '@clerk/astro/client'
   import { useAuth } from '@clerk/astro/react'

   export default function Home() {
     const organization = useStore($organizationStore)
     // The `useAuth()` hook gives you access to properties like `isSignedIn` and `has()`
     const { has, isSignedIn } = useAuth()
     const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

     // Check if the user is authenticated
     if (!isSignedIn) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>

     // Handle loading state
     if (organization === undefined) return <p>Loading...</p>

     // Check if there is an Active Organization
     if (organization === null) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

     // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
     if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) {
       return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>
     }

     // Check if Organization name matches (e.g., 'Acme Corp')
     if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {
       return (
         <p>
           This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization. Switch
           to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
         </p>
       )
     }

     return (
       <p>
         You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
         <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
       </p>
     )
   }
   ```

   Navigate to [localhost:4321/protected](http://localhost:4321/protected). You should see a green message confirming you are an admin in `Acme Corp`. Use the `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to switch Organizations or rename the Organization to show the red message.

8. ## It's time to build your B2B SaaS!

   You've added Clerk Organizations to your app 🎉.

   Here are some next steps you can take to scale your app:

   - **Control access** with [Custom Roles and Permissions](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions.md?sdk=astro): define granular Permissions for different user types within Organizations.

   - **Onboard entire companies** with [Verified Domains](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains.md?sdk=astro): automatically invite users with approved email domains (e.g., `@company.com`) to join Organizations without manual invitations.

   - **Enable Enterprise SSO** with [SAML and OIDC](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/sso.md?sdk=astro): let customers authenticate through their identity provider (e.g., Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace) with unlimited connections, no per-connection fees.
