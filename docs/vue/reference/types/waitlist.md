# Waitlist

The `Waitlist` object provides methods and properties to manage waitlist entries in your application. It's useful for building a custom flow instead of using the prebuilt [<Waitlist />](https://clerk.com/docs/vue/reference/components/authentication/waitlist.md) component.

## Properties

| Name      | Type                | Description                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id        | string | undefined | The unique identifier for the waitlist entry. undefined if the user has not joined the waitlist yet.     |
| createdAt | Date | null        | The date and time the waitlist entry was created. null if the user has not joined the waitlist yet.      |
| updatedAt | Date | null        | The date and time the waitlist entry was last updated. null if the user has not joined the waitlist yet. |

## Methods

### `join()`

Submits an email address to join the waitlist. This method creates a new waitlist entry for the provided email address.

```ts
function join(params: JoinWaitlistParams): Promise<{ error: unknown }>
```

#### `JoinWaitlistParams`

| Name         | Type   | Description                               |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| emailAddress | string | The email address to add to the waitlist. |

#### Example

```js
await clerk.waitlist.join({ emailAddress: 'test@example.com' })
```
