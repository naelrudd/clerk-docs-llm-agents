# getOrganizationList()

Gets the list of Organizations for the instance. By default, the list is returned in descending order by creation date (newest first).

Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response.md) object with a `data` property containing an array of [`Organization`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization.md) objects and a `totalCount` property containing the total number of Organizations for the instance.

```typescript
function getOrganizationList(params?: GetOrganizationListParams): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Organization[]>>
```

## Usage

> Using `clerkClient` varies based on the SDK you're using. Refer to the [overview](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md#example-get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

### Basic

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList()
```

### Limit the number of results

Gets a list of Organizations, limited to the specified number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Gets a list of Organizations, skipping the specified number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
})
```

### Filter by query

Gets a list of Organizations that match the query.

```tsx
// returns organizations that have 'test' in their name
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({ query: 'test' })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organizations/GET/organizations){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
