# getOrganizationMembershipList()

Gets the list of Organization memberships for the specified Organization. By default, the list is returned in descending order by creation date (newest first).

Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response.md) object with a `data` property containing an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership.md) objects and a `totalCount` property containing the total number of Organization memberships for the Organization.

> To get the list of Organization memberships **for your instance**, use [`getInstanceOrganizationMembershipList()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-instance-organization-membership-list.md).

```typescript
function getOrganizationMembershipList(params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>

## Usage

> Using `clerkClient` varies based on the SDK you're using. Refer to the [overview](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md#example-get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

### Basic

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_2ZUtbk2yvnFGItdeze1ivCh3uqh'

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId })
```

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId, limit })`

Gets a list of Organization memberships, limited to the specified number of results.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123'

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  organizationId,
  // returns the first 10 memberships
  limit: 10,
})
```

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId, offset })`

Gets a list of Organization memberships, skipping the specified number of results.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123'

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  organizationId,
  // skips the first 10 memberships
  offset: 10,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-memberships/GET/organizations/%7Borganization_id%7D/memberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
