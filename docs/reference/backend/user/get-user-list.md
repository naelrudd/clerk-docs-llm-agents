# getUserList()

Retrieves the list of users in your instance. By default, the list is returned in descending order by creation date (newest first).

Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response.md) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`User`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user.md) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of users in your instance.

```typescript
function getUserList(params: UserListParams): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<User[]>>
```

## Usage

> Using `clerkClient` varies based on the SDK you're using. Refer to the [overview](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md#example-get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

### Basic

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getUserList()
```

### Limit the number of results

Gets a list of users, ordered and limited to the specified number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({
  orderBy: '-created_at',
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Filter by email addresses and phone numbers

Gets a list of users filtered by the given email addresses and phone numbers.

```tsx
const emailAddress = ['email1@clerk.dev', 'email2@clerk.dev']

const phoneNumber = ['+12025550108']

// If these filters are included, the response will contain only users that own any of these emails and/or phone numbers.
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({ emailAddress, phoneNumber })
```

### Filter by query

To do a broader match through a list of fields, you can use the query parameter which partially matches the fields: `userId`, `emailAddress`, `phoneNumber`, `username`, `web3Wallet`, `firstName` and `lastName`.

```tsx
// Matches users with the string `test` matched in multiple user attributes.
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({
  query: 'test',
})
```

### Filter by last sign-in date

Gets a list of users who signed in within a specific time range.

```tsx
// Matches users that signed in between the given Unix timestamps.
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({
  lastSignInAtAfter: 1700690400000,
  lastSignInAtBefore: 1700690400010,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/users/GET/users){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
