# list()

Gets a list of waitlist entries for the instance. By default, the list is returned in descending order by creation date (newest first).

Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response.md) object with a `data` property containing an array of [`WaitlistEntry`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-waitlist-entry.md) objects and a `totalCount` property containing the total number of waitlist entries for the instance.

```typescript
function list(params: WaitlistEntryListParams): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<WaitlistEntry[]>>
```

## Usage

> Using `clerkClient` varies based on the SDK you're using. Refer to the [overview](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md#example-get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

### Filter by email address

Gets a list of waitlist entries for a given email address.

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.list({
  // returns a list of waitlist entries for a given email address
  query: 'user1@example.com',
})
```

### Filter by status

Gets a list of waitlist entries that have not yet been accepted.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.list({
  // returns a list of waitlist entries that have not yet been accepted
  status: 'pending',
})
```

### Limit the number of results

Gets a list of waitlist entries, limited to the specified number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.list({
  // returns the first 10 waitlist entries
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Gets a list of waitlist entries, skipping the specified number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.list({
  // skips the first 10 waitlist entries
  offset: 10,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/waitlist_entries`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/waitlist-entries/GET/waitlist_entries){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
