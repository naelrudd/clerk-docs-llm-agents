# list()

> Looking for the Publishable Key and Secret Key you use to connect your own app to Clerk? Those are different from the API keys described here. You can copy them from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard, or learn more in the [Clerk environment variables](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables.md) reference.

Gets a list of API keys for the given user or Organization. By default, the list is returned in descending order by creation date (newest first).

Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response.md) object with a `data` property containing an array of [`APIKey`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-api-key.md) objects and a `totalCount` property containing the total number of API keys for the user or Organization.

```typescript
function list(queryParams: GetAPIKeyListParams): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<APIKey[]>>
```

## `GetAPIKeyListParams`

| Property                      | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `includeInvalid?`             | `boolean` | Whether to include invalid API keys (revoked or expired). Defaults to `false`.                                                                                                         |
| <a id="limit"></a> `limit?`   | `number`  | Maximum number of items returned per request. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than `501`. Can be used for paginating the results together with offset. Defaults to `10`. |
| <a id="offset"></a> `offset?` | `number`  | Skip the first `offset` items when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.                               |
| `subject`                     | `string`  | The user or Organization ID to query API keys by.                                                                                                                                      |

## Usage

> Using `clerkClient` varies based on the SDK you're using. Refer to the [overview](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md) for usage details, including guidance on [how to access the `userId` and other properties](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/overview.md#example-get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

### Filer by user ID

Gets a list of API keys for a user

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const apiKeys = await clerkClient.apiKeys.list({
  subject: userId,
})
```

### Filter by user ID, including invalid API keys

Gets a list of API keys for a user, including invalid ones

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const apiKeys = await clerkClient.apiKeys.list({
  subject: userId,
  includeInvalid: true,
})
```

### Filter by user ID, including invalid API keys, with pagination

Gets a list of API keys for a user with pagination

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const apiKeys = await clerkClient.apiKeys.list({
  subject: userId,
  limit: 20,
  offset: 0,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/api_keys`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/api-keys/GET/api_keys){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
