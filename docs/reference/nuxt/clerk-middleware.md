# clerkMiddleware() | Nuxt

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper allows you to protect your Nuxt application **on the server-side**. It can be used to validate a user's authentication status or authorization status.

> `clerkMiddleware()` should be used to protect API routes only. It's not recommended to use it to protect pages as it will **only work on initial page reload**. On subsequent navigations, it won't run, because client-side navigation doesn't reach the server middleware. To protect pages, see the [guide on protecting content from unauthenticated users](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/protect-content.md).

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

By default, the Nuxt SDK **automatically** adds the `clerkMiddleware()` helper to your Nuxt application.

To **manually** configure the middleware:

1. In your `nuxt.config.ts` file, under the `clerk` property, set `skipServerMiddleware: true`.

   filename: nuxt.config.ts

   ```ts
   export default defineNuxtConfig({
     modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
     clerk: {
       skipServerMiddleware: true,
     },
   })
   ```
2. In your `server/middleware/` directory, create a file named `clerk.ts` with the following code:

   filename: server/middleware/clerk.ts

   ```ts
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'
   export default clerkMiddleware()
   ```

## Protect API routes

You can protect API routes using either or both of the following:

- [Authentication-based protection](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#authentication-based-protection): Verify if the user is signed in.
- [Authorization-based protection](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#authorization-based-protection): Verify if the user has the required privileges, such as a Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan. Learn more about [authorization checks](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks.md).

You can also [protect multiple routes](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#protect-multiple-routes) at once.

> Checks in `clerkMiddleware()` run before routing and rely on path matching, which can be bypassed with URL-encoding tricks. Treat them as an early rejection layer and keep the authoritative check on the route handler itself, as shown in [Protect multiple routes](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#protect-multiple-routes).

### Authentication-based protection

To protect routes based on user authentication status, you can check if the user is signed in by checking the `isAuthenticated` property on the [auth](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/overview.md#auth-object) object.

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is signed in and accessing a protected route. If they aren't signed in, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

> This middleware check is an optional early-rejection layer. The authoritative check belongs on the route handler itself, as shown in [Protect multiple routes](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#protect-multiple-routes).

filename: server/middleware/clerk.ts
```tsx
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth()
  const isAdminRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/admin')

  if (!isAuthenticated && isAdminRoute) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }
})
```

### Authorization-based protection

To protect routes based on user authorization status, you can use the `has()` helper to check if the user has the required [privileges, such as a Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks.md). The `has()` helper is available on the [auth](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/overview.md#auth-object) object.

> This middleware check is an optional early-rejection layer. The authoritative check belongs on the route handler itself, as shown in [Protect multiple routes](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#protect-multiple-routes).

#### Example: Protect routes based on Custom Permissions

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is accessing a protected route. If so, it checks if the user has the required Custom Permission. If they don't, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

filename: server/middleware/clerk.ts
```ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { has } = event.context.auth()
  const isInvoicesRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/invoices')
  const canCreateInvoices = has({
    permission: 'org:invoices:create',
  })

  // Check if the user is accessing a protected route
  if (isInvoicesRoute) {
    // Check if the user has the required Permission
    if (!canCreateInvoices) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 403,
        statusMessage: 'Forbidden: Missing Permission to create invoices',
      })
    }
  }
})
```

#### Example: Protect routes based on default Roles

> It's best practice to use Permission-based authorization over Role-based authorization, as it reduces complexity and increases security. Usually, complex Role checks can be refactored with a single Permission check.

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is accessing a protected route. If so, it checks if the user has the required admin Role. If they don't, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

filename: server/middleware/clerk.ts
```ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { has } = event.context.auth()
  const isAdminRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/admin')
  const isAdmin = has({
    role: 'org:admin',
  })

  // Check if the user is accessing a protected route
  if (isAdminRoute) {
    // Check if the user has the required Role
    if (!isAdmin) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 403,
        statusMessage: 'Forbidden: Admin access required',
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Protect multiple routes

To reuse an authentication or authorization policy across API routes, define a helper in `server/utils/` and call it from each handler. Nitro auto-imports exports from this directory. Because each resolved handler enforces the policy directly, authorization doesn't depend on matching request paths in server middleware.

For pages, use Nuxt route middleware. See the [guide on protecting content](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/protect-content.md).

> Clerk's `createRouteMatcher()` helper was removed in `@clerk/nuxt` v3. For migration details, see [createRouteMatcher() (removed)](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#create-route-matcher).

The following helpers require authentication and optionally enforce a Permission:

filename: server/utils/requireAuth.ts
```ts
import type { OrganizationCustomPermissionKey } from '@clerk/nuxt/types'
import type { H3Event } from 'h3'

export function requireAuth(event: H3Event) {
  const { isAuthenticated, userId, has } = event.context.auth()

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }

  return { userId, has }
}

export function requirePermission(event: H3Event, permission: OrganizationCustomPermissionKey) {
  const { userId, has } = requireAuth(event)

  if (!has({ permission })) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 403,
      statusMessage: 'Forbidden: Missing required Permission',
    })
  }

  return { userId }
}
```

Each route handler calls the helper that matches its policy:

**Authentication**

filename: server/api/admin/users.ts
```ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const { userId } = requireAuth(event)

  return { userId }
})
```

**Authorization**

filename: server/api/invoices/index.ts
```ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const { userId } = requirePermission(event, 'org:invoices:create')

  return { userId }
})
```

You can also reject unauthenticated API requests early in `clerkMiddleware()`, before they reach any handler. List the routes that are _public_ and require authentication for everything else, so new API routes are protected by default. Middleware sees the request path before routing, and path matching there can diverge from where Nitro actually routes the request (`/api/%61dmin` won't match a check for `/api/admin` but can still route to it), so treat this as an extra layer on top of per-resource checks, never as the only protection.

filename: server/middleware/clerk.ts
```ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

// Public API routes. Everything else under `/api` requires authentication.
const publicRoutes = ['/api/webhooks', '/api/health']

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth()
  // Match on the pathname; `event.path` includes the query string
  const { pathname } = getRequestURL(event)

  const isApiRoute = pathname === '/api' || pathname.startsWith('/api/')
  const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.some(
    (route) => pathname === route || pathname.startsWith(`${route}/`),
  )

  if (isApiRoute && !isPublicRoute && !isAuthenticated) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }
})
```

## `createRouteMatcher()` (removed) {{ id: 'create-route-matcher' }}

> `createRouteMatcher()` was removed in `@clerk/nuxt` v3. Middleware-based auth checks rely on path matching, which can diverge from how Nitro routes requests and leave protected resources reachable. Move auth checks onto the resources themselves, as shown below.

`createRouteMatcher()` was a Clerk helper function that accepted an array of routes and checked if the route the user was trying to visit matched one of them, so that auth checks could run in the middleware for matching routes:

filename: server/middleware/clerk.ts
```ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/invoices(.*)', '/api/admin(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth()

  if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute(event)) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }
})
```

It was also auto-imported on the client for use inside Nuxt route middleware to match pages.

To migrate, move the auth check into each resource the matcher protected. `clerkMiddleware()` itself is still required for Clerk to work; it's added automatically unless you set `skipServerMiddleware`. Role and Permission checks with [`has()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md#has) also move onto the resource. Middleware logic unrelated to auth protection, such as locale redirects or headers, can stay, using plain path checks with `getRequestURL(event).pathname`. Plain path checks don't normalize percent-encoding (`/api/%61dmin` won't match a check for `/api/admin`), so never rely on them as a resource's only protection.

**Nuxt page**

filename: app/pages/dashboard.vue
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// `auth` is a named route middleware in `app/middleware/auth.ts` that
// redirects signed-out users.
definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
</script>

<template>
  <h1>Dashboard</h1>
  <!-- Renders child routes, which inherit the `auth` middleware -->
  <NuxtPage />
</template>
```

**API route**

filename: server/api/invoices/index.ts
```ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = event.context.auth()

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }

  return { userId }
})
```

If several API routes share the same policy, define the check once in a shared helper, as shown in [Protect multiple routes](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nuxt/clerk-middleware.md#protect-multiple-routes). For page-protection patterns, including the named `auth` route middleware and route groups, see the [guide on protecting content](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/protect-content.md).

If you want to hand this migration to a coding agent, use the following prompt:

```md
Migrate my Nuxt project away from Clerk's removed `createRouteMatcher` API.

1. Find every matcher created with `createRouteMatcher`, along with the logic
   that uses it (throwing 401 errors, calling `navigateTo('/sign-in')`, etc.).
   Matchers can appear in Nitro server middleware (imported from
   `@clerk/nuxt/server`) or in Nuxt route middleware (auto-imported).
2. For every resource those matchers protected, move the auth check onto the
   resource itself. If a matcher was used inverted (e.g. `if (!isPublicPage(to))`),
   the protected set is every route it does not match, so every non-public
   resource needs a check:
   - In API routes and server handlers, add this at the top of the handler:
     const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth();
     if (!isAuthenticated) throw createError({ statusCode: 401, statusMessage: 'Unauthorized' });
   - For pages, create a named route middleware in `app/middleware/` that checks
     `useAuth()` and redirects with `navigateTo()`, then opt pages into it with
     `definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })`. Child routes inherit the middleware
     applied to their parent.
   - Keep any role or permission checks (`event.context.auth().has(...)`) with
     the resource as well.
3. Remove the `createRouteMatcher` imports and calls. Keep `clerkMiddleware()`
   itself (it's added automatically unless `skipServerMiddleware` is set).
   Middleware logic unrelated to auth protection (locale redirects, headers,
   etc.) may stay, using plain `getRequestURL(event).pathname` checks. Plain
   pathname checks do not normalize percent-encoding (`/api/%61dmin` will not
   match a check for `/api/admin`), so never use them for auth or security
   decisions. Those belong on the resource itself, as in step 2.
4. Ensure every page and endpoint previously covered by a matcher pattern
   (including glob patterns like `/dashboard(.*)`) now has its own check, then
   verify the project builds.

```

## `clerkMiddleware()` options

The `clerkMiddleware()` function accepts an optional object. The following options are available:

| Name                     | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ["/me", "/me/(.\*)"]                 | ["/user/:any", "/user/:any/(.\*)"] |             |

### Pattern

A `Pattern` is a `string` that represents the structure of a URL path. In addition to any valid URL, it may include:

- Named path parameters prefixed with a colon (e.g., `:id`, `:slug`, `:any`).
- Wildcard token, `(.*)`, which matches the remainder of the path.
