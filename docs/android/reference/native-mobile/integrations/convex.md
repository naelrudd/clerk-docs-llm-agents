# Integrate Convex with Clerk

**Example Repository**

- [Clerk Convex Kotlin](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-convex-kotlin)

**Before you start**

- [Set up a Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md?sdk=android)
- [Integrate Clerk into your app](https://clerk.com/docs/android/getting-started/quickstart.md)
- [Integrate Convex into your app](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts)

With [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), you can build a backend with a provided realtime database, file storage, text search, scheduling, and more. Paired with Clerk's authentication and user management features, you can build native mobile apps with a secure auth flow and realtime data access.

This guide shows how to integrate Convex with Clerk in your native mobile app. It assumes you have already integrated both Convex and Clerk in your app.

1. ## Set up Clerk as a Convex auth provider

   For your Clerk session token to work with Convex, you need to set up the Convex integration in Clerk.

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [Convex integration setup](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).
   2. Choose your configuration options, and then select **Activate Convex integration**. This will reveal the Frontend API URL for your Clerk instance.
   3. Save the URL. In development, its format is `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format is `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.
2. ## Map additional claims (optional)

   If you need to map additional claims, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/sessions) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

   In the **Claims** section, the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates.md?sdk=android#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.
3. ## Configure Convex with Clerk's Frontend API URL

   1. Convex backend functions don't read your app's `.env` file. In your Convex project, run the following command to set your Clerk Frontend API URL:

      filename: terminal

      ```sh
      npx convex env set CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL '{{fapi_url}}'
      ```

      > This command needs an existing Convex deployment. If you don't have one yet, run `npx convex dev --once` to configure the project and create it, then rerun the command above.

   2. In your Convex project's `convex` folder, create an `auth.config.ts` file with the following configuration:

      filename: convex/auth.config.ts

      ```ts
      import type { AuthConfig } from 'convex/server'

      export default {
        providers: [
          {
            domain: process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL!,
            applicationID: 'convex',
          },
        ],
      } satisfies AuthConfig
      ```
4. ## Sync your auth configuration

   In your Convex project, run the following command to sync your auth configuration to your Convex backend:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex dev
   ```
5. ## Add the Clerk Convex SDK to your app

   Add the `clerk-convex-kotlin` dependency to your app:

   filename: app/build.gradle.kts

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       implementation("com.clerk:clerk-convex-kotlin:<latest-version>")
   }
   ```

   Initialize Clerk first with your Clerk Publishable Key, then create a `ConvexClientWithAuth` using `ClerkConvexAuthProvider().createConvexClientWithAuth()`, passing in your Convex deployment URL. Refer to the [Convex deployment docs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings) for more info.

   filename: MyApplication.kt

   ```kotlin
   import android.app.Application
   import com.clerk.api.Clerk
   import com.clerk.convex.ClerkConvexAuthProvider
   import com.clerk.convex.createConvexClientWithAuth

   class MyApplication : Application() {
     private val authProvider = ClerkConvexAuthProvider()

     override fun onCreate() {
       super.onCreate()
       Clerk.initialize(
         context = this,
         publishableKey = "{{pub_key}}",
       )

       val convex = authProvider.createConvexClientWithAuth(
         deploymentUrl = "YOUR_CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL",
         context = applicationContext,
       )

       // Store `convex` in app state (for example, a repository or DI container).
     }
   }
   ```

   After users authenticate with Clerk, auth state is automatically synced to Convex. Use `convex` for queries, mutations, actions, and auth state. If you don't need to keep an auth provider instance, `createClerkConvexClient()` is available as a shorthand helper.
6. ## Show UI based on auth state

   Convex exposes auth state from the authenticated client. Use that state to render loading, signed-out, and signed-in UI.

   filename: AuthViewModel.kt

   ```kotlin
   import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel
   import androidx.lifecycle.viewModelScope
   import dev.convex.android.AuthState
   import dev.convex.android.ConvexClientWithAuth
   import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

   class AuthViewModel(
     private val convex: ConvexClientWithAuth<String>,
   ) : ViewModel() {
     init {
       viewModelScope.launch {
         convex.authState.collect { authState ->
           when (authState) {
             is AuthState.AuthLoading -> showLoading()
             is AuthState.Unauthenticated -> showSignIn()
             is AuthState.Authenticated -> showAuthenticatedContent()
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Collect `convex.authState` in your `ViewModel` and map each state to the appropriate screen.
7. ## Make requests and present data in the UI

   With Clerk and Convex configured, authenticated requests stay in sync so you can subscribe and render data with minimal setup.

   filename: MessagesViewModel.kt

   ```kotlin
   import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel
   import androidx.lifecycle.viewModelScope
   import dev.convex.android.ConvexClientWithAuth
   import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.SharingStarted
   import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow
   import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.catch
   import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.stateIn

   class MessagesViewModel(
     convex: ConvexClientWithAuth<String>,
   ) : ViewModel() {

     val messages: StateFlow<List<Message>> =
       convex
         .subscribe<List<Message>>("messages:list")
         .catch { emit(emptyList()) } // keep old behavior: fail -> show nothing
         .stateIn(
           scope = viewModelScope,
           started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(stopTimeoutMillis = 5_000),
           initialValue = emptyList()
         )
   }
   ```

   filename: MessagesScreen.kt

   ```kotlin
   import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column
   import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.PaddingValues
   import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxWidth
   import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding
   import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn
   import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.items
   import androidx.compose.material3.Text
   import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
   import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
   import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp
   import androidx.lifecycle.compose.collectAsStateWithLifecycle

   @Composable
   fun MessagesScreen(
     viewModel: MessagesViewModel,
     modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
   ) {
     val messages = viewModel.messages.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value

     LazyColumn(
       modifier = modifier,
       contentPadding = PaddingValues(12.dp),
     ) {
       items(items = messages, key = { it.id }) { message ->
         Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(vertical = 6.dp)) {
           Text(message.author)
           Text(message.body)
         }
       }
     }
   }

   data class Message(
     val id: String,
     val author: String,
     val body: String,
   )
   ```
8. ## Deploy to production

   Set the Frontend API URL from your Clerk production instance on your Convex production deployment. In your Convex project, run:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex env --prod set CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL 'https://clerk.<your-domain>.com'
   ```

   Then, run the following command to sync your auth configuration to your Convex production deployment:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex deploy
   ```
