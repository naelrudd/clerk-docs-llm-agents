The `OrganizationListView` renders a standalone account picker for choosing between the user's Personal Account and Organization accounts. It lists the Personal Account when allowed, Organization memberships, pending Organization invitations, suggested Organizations, and a **Create organization** action for users who can create Organizations.

Personal Account selection clears the Active Organization. Organization selection sets the selected Organization as **active**.
