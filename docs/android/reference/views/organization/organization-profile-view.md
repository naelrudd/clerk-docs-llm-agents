The `OrganizationProfileView` renders the Active Organization's management interface. It includes permission-gated Organization profile editing, member management, invitations, Membership Requests, Verified Domains, and flows for leaving or deleting the Organization.

`OrganizationProfileView` renders content only when a session has an Active Organization. Rows and actions are shown according to the current user's Organization membership Permissions and the current environment settings.

- **Verified domains** appears when Organization domains are enabled and the user has `canReadDomains` or `canManageDomains`.
- **Leave Organization** appears when there is an Active Organization membership.
- **Delete Organization** appears when dashboard admin delete is enabled, `organization.adminDeleteEnabled` is `true`, and the user has `canDeleteOrganization`.
