# Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your Nuxt app with Clerk

This guide shows you how to use the [<SignIn />](https://clerk.com/docs/nuxt/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md) component to build a custom page **that allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [custom sign-up page guide](https://clerk.com/docs/nuxt/guides/development/custom-sign-up-page.md).

> If prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview.md?sdk=nuxt).

1. ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

   The following example demonstrates how to render the `<SignIn />` component on a dedicated page using a [Nuxt catch-all route](https://nuxt.com/docs/directory-structure/app/pages#catch-all-route).

   filename: app/pages/sign-in/[...slug].vue

   ```vue
   <template>
     <SignIn />
   </template>
   ```
2. ## Configure your sign-in-or-up page

   Set the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.

   There are other environment variables that you can set to customize Clerk's redirect behavior, such as `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL`. Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls.md?sdk=nuxt).

   filename: .env

   ```env
   NUXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   ```
3. ## Visit your new page

   Run your project with the following command:

   ```npm
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
