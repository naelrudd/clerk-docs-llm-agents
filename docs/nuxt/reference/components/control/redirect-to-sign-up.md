# <RedirectToSignUp />

The `<RedirectToSignUp />` component will navigate to the sign up URL which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

## Example

filename: App.vue
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Components are automatically imported
</script>

<template>
  <Show when="signed-in">
    <UserButton />
  </Show>
  <Show when="signed-out">
    <RedirectToSignUp />
  </Show>
</template>
```
