# Authentication across different domains

**Example Repository**

- [Satellite Domain demo using Turborepo with Clerk, Next.js, and React](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-multidomain-demo)

> This feature or workflow is considered **advanced** - it may not be part of an official Clerk SDK or fall within typical usage patterns. The Clerk support team will do their best to assist you, but cannot guarantee a resolution for this type of advanced usage.

> This guide addresses authentication across different domains with shared sessions. For example, `example-site.com` and `example-site-admin.com`. This is not to be confused with [authentication across subdomains](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/deployment/production.md#authentication-across-subdomains) with shared sessions, which works by default with Clerk.
>
> It is not recommended to use **passkeys** as a form of authentication when sharing sessions across different domains. Learn more about [domain restrictions for passkeys](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/passkeys.md#domain-restrictions-for-passkeys).

Clerk supports sharing sessions across different domains by adding one or many "satellite" domains to an application.

Your "primary" domain is where the authentication state lives, and satellite domains are able to securely read that state from the primary domain, enabling a seamless authentication flow across domains.

Users must complete both the sign-in and sign-up flows on the primary domain by using the [<SignIn />](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md) component or the [useSignIn()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/hooks/use-sign-in.md) hook for sign-in and the [<SignUp />](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md) component or the [useSignUp()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/hooks/use-sign-up.md) hook for sign-up.

**For AI agents:** Register and inspect satellite domains from the terminal instead of the Dashboard: run `npx clerk@latest api ls domains` to find the endpoint, then `npx clerk@latest api <path> -X POST -d '<json>'` to add one. Pass the path explicitly — bare `npx clerk@latest api` only opens the interactive builder, which needs a TTY. Use `npx clerk@latest env pull` to write keys into the satellite app's env file. Install [Clerk's skills](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/ai/skills.md) with `npx skills add clerk/skills` for correct CLI and SDK usage.

### How authentication syncing works

The syncing behavior between satellite and primary domains is controlled by the `satelliteAutoSync` option.

With `satelliteAutoSync: false` (the default), satellite domains do not automatically sync authentication state with the primary domain when a user visits the page. This means there is no upfront performance cost for users visiting a satellite domain. Authentication state is only synced when a user initiates a sign-in or sign-up action:

1. When a user selects "Sign in" on the satellite domain, they are redirected to the primary domain.
   - If the user is already signed in on the primary domain, they are immediately redirected back to the satellite domain with the existing auth state — no additional user action is required.
   - If the user is not signed in on the primary domain, they complete the sign-in (or sign-up) flow there and are then redirected back to the satellite domain.
2. After the initial sync, signing out from either domain signs out from all domains.

See [Build sign-in and sign-up links](#build-sign-in-and-sign-up-links) for setup.

If you set `satelliteAutoSync: true`, the satellite domain **will automatically redirect to the primary domain on first load** to sync authentication state, even if the user has no session. This matches the original [Core 2](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/upgrading/upgrade-guides/core-2.md) behavior and is useful if you want users who are already signed in on the primary domain to be automatically recognized on the satellite without needing to select "Sign in". However, this comes with a performance cost since every first visit triggers a redirect.

### Build sign-in and sign-up links

When `satelliteAutoSync` is `false` (the default), you must ensure your sign-in and sign-up links on the satellite domain use [Clerk.buildSignInUrl()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/objects/clerk.md#build-sign-in-url) and [Clerk.buildSignUpUrl()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/objects/clerk.md#build-sign-up-url) instead of hardcoded URLs. These methods automatically append the `__clerk_synced=false` sync trigger parameter to the redirect URL. This parameter tells the satellite app to sync the session when the user returns from the primary domain.

> If you hardcode sign-in URLs (e.g., `<a href="https://primary.dev/sign-in">`) instead of using `buildSignInUrl()`, the sync trigger parameter will not be added. As a result, when the user returns to the satellite after signing in, the session will not be recognized.

```tsx
// Example sign-in button in the satellite app
function SignInButton() {
  const { buildSignInUrl } = useClerk()

  return <a href={buildSignInUrl()}>Sign in</a>
}
```

## How to add satellite domains

> This feature requires a [paid plan](https://clerk.com/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the [pricing](https://clerk.com/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page for more information.

1. ### Create your application and install Clerk

   > Currently, multi-domain can be added to any Next.js, TanStack Start, or Nuxt application. For other React frameworks, multi-domain is still supported as long as you do not use server rendering or hydration.

   To get started, you need to create an application from the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Once you create an instance via the Clerk Dashboard, you will be prompted to choose a domain. This is your primary domain. For the purposes of this guide:

   - In production, the primary domain will be `primary.dev`.
   - In development, the primary domain will be `localhost:3000`.

   When building your sign-in flow, you must configure it to run within your primary application, e.g., on `/sign-in`.

   > For more information about creating your application, see the [setup guide](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md).
2. ### Add your first satellite domain

   To add a satellite domain:

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Domains**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/domains) page.
   2. Select the **Satellites** tab.
   3. Select the **Add satellite domain** button and follow the instructions provided.

   For the purposes of this guide:

   - In production, the satellite domain will be `satellite.dev`.
   - In development, the satellite domain will be `localhost:3001`.
3. ### Complete DNS setup for your satellite domain

   To use a satellite domain **in production**, you will need to add a CNAME record for the `clerk` subdomain. **For development instances, you can skip this step.**

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Domains**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/domains) page.
   2. Select the **Satellites** tab.
   3. Select the satellite domain you just added.
   4. Under **DNS Configuration**, follow the instructions to add a CNAME record in your DNS provider's settings.

   Once your CNAME record is set up correctly, you should see a **Verified** label next to your satellite domain.

   > It can take up to 48hrs for DNS records to fully propagate.

   > If you're unable to add a CNAME record for the Frontend API on the satellite domain, you can use a proxy instead. See [Proxying the Clerk Frontend API](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/proxy-fapi.md#proxying-for-satellite-domains) for more information.
4. ### Configure your primary and satellite apps

   There are two ways to configure your primary and satellite apps to work together:

   - Using environment variables
   - Using properties

   Use the following tabs to select your preferred method. Clerk recommends using **environment variables**.

   **Environment variables**

   To configure satellite domains with environment variables, you need to set values in both **your primary app** and **your satellite app**.

   > This example is written for Next.js App Router but can be adapted for any framework/language. Next.js prefixes environment variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` if they need to be exposed to the frontend. You must update this prefix for the framework or environment variable loader that you are using.

   **Primary app**

   Add the following environment variables to your primary domain application. Your Publishable Key and Secret Key can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

   filename: .env

   ```env
   # In development, your API keys will start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`.
   # In production, your API keys will start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`.
   # Ensure you load the correct keys.
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   ```

   You will also need to add the `allowedRedirectOrigins` property wherever you initialize the Clerk integration to ensure that the redirect back from primary to satellite domain works correctly. For most SDKs, that means passing it to [<ClerkProvider>](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md). In other SDKs, it may be configured through the framework's Clerk integration or plugin. Refer to your framework's [quickstart guide](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/overview.md) to find where to set it. For example:

   **Development**

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <ClerkProvider allowedRedirectOrigins={['http://localhost:3001']}>{children}</ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

   **Production**

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <ClerkProvider allowedRedirectOrigins={['https://satellite.dev']}>{children}</ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

   **Satellite app**

   Add the following environment variables to your satellite domain application. Your Publishable Key and Secret Key can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

   **Development**

   filename: .env

   ```env
   # In development, your API keys will start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` respectively.
   # Ensure you load the correct keys.
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN=localhost:3001
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=http://localhost:3000/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=http://localhost:3000/sign-up
   ```

   **Production**

   filename: .env

   ```env
   # In production, your API keys will start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_` respectively.
   # Ensure you load the correct keys.
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN=satellite.dev
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=https://primary.dev/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=https://primary.dev/sign-up
   ```

   **Properties**

   To configure satellite domains with properties, use the following properties across your primary and satellite apps:

   | Property                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `isSatellite`            | Defines the app as a satellite app when `true`.                                                                                                                                                     |
   | `domain`                 | Sets the domain of the satellite application. This is required because the Publishable Key is shared across your multi-domain apps, so Clerk cannot infer the satellite domain from it.             |
   | `signInUrl`              | The URL used when signing in on your satellite application. It needs to point to your primary application. This option is optional for production instances and required for development instances. |
   | `signUpUrl`              | The URL used when signing up on your satellite application. It needs to point to your primary application. This option is optional for production instances and required for development instances. |
   | `allowedRedirectOrigins` | A list of origins that the primary domain is allowed to redirect back to.                                                                                                                           |

   > The `URL` parameter that can be passed to `isSatellite` and `domain` is the request URL for server-side usage or the current location for client usage.

   These properties are available wherever you initialize the Clerk integration. For most SDKs, that means passing them to the [<ClerkProvider>](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md) component. In other SDKs, they may be configured through the framework's Clerk integration or plugin. Refer to your framework's [quickstart guide](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/overview.md) to find where to set them.

   In a Next.js setup, configure [<ClerkProvider>](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md) in both your primary and satellite apps, then update [clerkMiddleware()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware.md) in the satellite app. If your framework does not provide equivalent middleware or request handling for satellite domains, use the environment variable setup instead.

   > You should set your `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in your environment variables even if you're using props to configure satellite domains.

   **Primary app**

   In the Next.js project associated with your primary domain, configure your `<ClerkProvider>` as shown in the following example:

   **Development**

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     const primarySignInUrl = '/sign-in'
     const primarySignUpUrl = '/sign-up'
     const satelliteUrl = 'http://localhost:3001'

     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <ClerkProvider
             signInUrl={primarySignInUrl}
             signUpUrl={primarySignUpUrl}
             allowedRedirectOrigins={[satelliteUrl]}
           >
             <p>Primary Next.js app</p>
             {children}
           </ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

   **Production**

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     const primarySignInUrl = '/sign-in'
     const primarySignUpUrl = '/sign-up'
     const satelliteUrl = 'https://satellite.dev'

     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <ClerkProvider
             signInUrl={primarySignInUrl}
             signUpUrl={primarySignUpUrl}
             allowedRedirectOrigins={[satelliteUrl]}
           >
             <p>Primary Next.js app</p>
             {children}
           </ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

   **Satellite app**

   In the Next.js project associated with your satellite domain, configure your `<ClerkProvider>` as shown in the following example:

   **Development**

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     const primarySignInUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/sign-in'
     const primarySignUpUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/sign-up'
     const satelliteDomain = 'localhost:3001'

     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <ClerkProvider
             isSatellite
             domain={satelliteDomain}
             signInUrl={primarySignInUrl}
             signUpUrl={primarySignUpUrl}
           >
             <title>Satellite Next.js app</title>
             <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
             {children}
           </ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

   **Production**

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     const primarySignInUrl = 'https://primary.dev/sign-in'
     const primarySignUpUrl = 'https://primary.dev/sign-up'
     const satelliteDomain = 'satellite.dev'

     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <ClerkProvider
             isSatellite
             domain={satelliteDomain}
             signInUrl={primarySignInUrl}
             signUpUrl={primarySignUpUrl}
           >
             <title>Satellite Next.js app</title>
             <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
             {children}
           </ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

   And the middleware associated with your satellite domain should look like this:

   > If you're using Next.js ≤15, name your file `middleware.ts` instead of `proxy.ts`. The code itself remains the same; only the filename changes.

   **Development**

   filename: proxy.ts

   ```ts
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

   // Set the necessary options for a satellite application
   const options = {
     isSatellite: true,
     signInUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/sign-in',
     signUpUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/sign-up',
     domain: 'localhost:3001',

     // satelliteAutoSync defaults to false. Uncomment below to automatically sync auth state on first load.
     // This adds a redirect on every first visit, which comes with a performance cost.
     // satelliteAutoSync: true,
   }

   export default clerkMiddleware(options)

   export const config = {
     matcher: [
       // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
       '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
       // Always run for API routes
       '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
       // Always run for Clerk-specific frontend API routes
       '/__clerk/(.*)',
     ],
   }
   ```

   **Production**

   filename: proxy.ts

   ```ts
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

   // Set the necessary options for a satellite application
   const options = {
     isSatellite: true,
     signInUrl: 'https://primary.dev/sign-in',
     signUpUrl: 'https://primary.dev/sign-up',
     domain: 'satellite.dev',

     // satelliteAutoSync defaults to false. Uncomment below to automatically sync auth state on first load.
     // This adds a redirect on every first visit, which comes with a performance cost.
     // satelliteAutoSync: true,
   }

   export default clerkMiddleware(options)

   export const config = {
     matcher: [
       // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
       '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
       // Always run for API routes
       '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
       // Always run for Clerk-specific frontend API routes
       '/__clerk/(.*)',
     ],
   }
   ```
5. ### Ready to go

   Your satellite application should now be able to access the authentication state from your satellite domain!

   To verify it's working, visit your satellite domain and select "Sign in" — you should be redirected to the primary domain and back with an active session. For details on the sync flow, see the [How authentication syncing works](#how-authentication-syncing-works) section.

   You can repeat this process and create as many satellite applications as you need.
