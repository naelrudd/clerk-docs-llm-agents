## Viewing and filtering logs

Both log pages display a reverse-chronological feed of events. The available filters differ by log type.

**Application Logs**

You can filter Application Logs by:

- **Event type**: Filter by event type (e.g., `user.created`, `sign_in.completed`). Supports trailing wildcards (e.g., `sign_in.*`).
- **Actor**: Filter by the user or API key that triggered the event.
- **Subject**: Filter by the resource ID being acted upon (e.g., a user ID or Organization ID).
- **IP address**: Filter by the IP address the event originated from.
- **Trace ID**: Filter by distributed trace ID for correlating events across systems.
- **Device**: Filter by device ID.
- **Date range**: Set a time window to scope the results.

For a complete list of event types, see [Supported events](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/dashboard/logs/application-logs.md#supported-events).

**Admin Logs**

You can filter Admin Logs by:

- **Event type**: Filter by event type (e.g., `oauth_application.updated`, `domain.created`). Supports trailing wildcards (e.g., `oauth_application.*`).
- **Instance**: Filter by the instance the action targeted.
- **Application**: Filter by the application the action targeted.
- **Actor**: Filter by the actor that triggered the event — a Dashboard user, an instance Secret Key, or a Platform API access token.
- **IP address**: Filter by the IP address the action originated from.
- **Time range**: Set a time window to scope the results.

For a complete list of event types, see [Supported events](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/dashboard/logs/admin-logs.md#supported-events).

## Log detail view

Select any log entry to view its full details, including:

- **Event metadata**: Common fields such as event type, timestamp, actor, and subject. Application Logs also include the event source.
- **Payload**: The full event data as a JSON object, containing the state of the resource at the time of the event.

## Plans and retention
