**Before you start**

- [Set up a Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md)
- [Integrate a Clerk SDK into your app](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/overview.md)
- [Integrate Convex into your app](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts)

With [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), you can build a backend with a provided realtime database, file storage, text search, scheduling and more. Paired with Clerk's user authentication and management features, you can build a powerful application with minimal effort. This tutorial will show you how to integrate Clerk into your Convex application. It assumes that you have already integrated both Convex and one of Clerk's SDKs into your app.

1. ## Set up Clerk as a Convex auth provider

   For your Clerk session token to work with Convex, you need to set up the Convex integration in Clerk.

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [Convex integration setup](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).
   2. Choose your configuration options, and then select **Activate Convex integration**. This will reveal the Frontend API URL for your Clerk instance.
   3. Save the URL. In development, its format is `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format is `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.
2. ## Map additional claims (optional)

   If you need to map additional claims, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/sessions) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

   In the **Claims** section, the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates.md#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.
3. ## Configure Convex with Clerk's Frontend API URL

   1. Convex backend functions don't read your app's `.env` file. In your Convex project, run the following command to set your Clerk Frontend API URL:

      filename: terminal

      ```sh
      npx convex env set CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL '{{fapi_url}}'
      ```

      > This command needs an existing Convex deployment. If you don't have one yet, run `npx convex dev --once` to configure the project and create it, then rerun the command above.

   2. In your Convex project's `convex` folder, create an `auth.config.ts` file with the following configuration:

      filename: convex/auth.config.ts

      ```ts
      import type { AuthConfig } from 'convex/server'

      export default {
        providers: [
          {
            domain: process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL!,
            applicationID: 'convex',
          },
        ],
      } satisfies AuthConfig
      ```
4. ## Sync your auth configuration

   In your Convex project, run the following command to sync your auth configuration to your Convex backend:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex dev
   ```
5. ## Configure the Clerk and Convex providers

   Both Clerk and Convex have provider components that are required to provide authentication and client context. You should already have Clerk's provider component, `<ClerkProvider>`, in your app. Convex offers a provider that is specifically for integrating with Clerk called `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`.

   **Next.js**

   `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>` must run on the client: it needs a `ConvexReactClient` instance and Clerk's `useAuth()` hook, neither of which a Server Component can provide. Your `app/layout.tsx`, where you would use `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`, is a Server Component, so you must first create a _wrapper_ Client Component around `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`.

   filename: components/ConvexClientProvider.tsx

   ```tsx
   'use client'

   import { ReactNode } from 'react'
   import { ConvexReactClient } from 'convex/react'
   import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from 'convex/react-clerk'
   import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL) {
     throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL in your .env file')
   }

   const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL)

   export default function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
         {children}
       </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
     )
   }
   ```

   Now, your Server Component, `app/layout.tsx`, can use the wrapper component, `<ConvexClientProvider>`. It's important that `<ClerkProvider>` wraps `<ConvexClientProvider>`, and not the other way around, as Convex needs to be able to access the Clerk context.

   filename: app/layout.tsx

   ```tsx
   import type { Metadata } from 'next'
   import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'
   import './globals.css'
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
   import ConvexClientProvider from '@/components/ConvexClientProvider'

   const geistSans = Geist({
     variable: '--font-geist-sans',
     subsets: ['latin'],
   })

   const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
     variable: '--font-geist-mono',
     subsets: ['latin'],
   })

   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',
     description: 'Generated by create next app',
   }

   export default function RootLayout({
     children,
   }: Readonly<{
     children: React.ReactNode
   }>) {
     return (
       <html lang="en" className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} h-full antialiased`}>
         <body className="min-h-full flex flex-col">
           <ClerkProvider>
             <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
           </ClerkProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```
6. ## Show UI based on auth state

   You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using Convex's `<Authenticated>`, `<Unauthenticated>` and `<AuthLoading>` helper components. These should be used instead of Clerk's `<Show when="signed-in">`, `<Show when="signed-out">` and `<ClerkLoading>` components, respectively.

   It's important to use the [`useConvexAuth()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#useconvexauth) hook instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook when you need to check whether the user is signed in or
   not. The `useConvexAuth()` hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the Convex backend has validated it.

   In the following example, the `<Content />` component is a child of `<Authenticated>`, so its content and any of its child components are guaranteed to have an authenticated user, and Convex queries can require authentication.

   **Next.js**

   ```tsx
   'use client'

   import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated } from 'convex/react'
   import { SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'
   import { useQuery } from 'convex/react'
   import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <>
         <Authenticated>
           <UserButton />
           <Content />
         </Authenticated>
         <Unauthenticated>
           <SignInButton />
         </Unauthenticated>
       </>
     )
   }

   function Content() {
     const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser)
     return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>
   }
   ```
7. ## Use auth state in your Convex functions

   If the client is authenticated, you can access its verified token claims by calling `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`.

   If the client isn't authenticated, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` returns `null`.

   > Make sure that the component calling this query is a child of `<Authenticated>` from `convex/react`. Otherwise, the query throws whenever it runs before authentication finishes or while the user is signed out.

   filename: convex/messages.ts

   ```ts
   import { query } from './_generated/server'

   export const getForCurrentUser = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()
       if (identity === null) {
         throw new Error('Not authenticated')
       }
       return await ctx.db
         .query('messages')
         .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field('author'), identity.email))
         .collect()
     },
   })
   ```
8. ## Deploy to production

   Set the Frontend API URL from your Clerk production instance on your Convex production deployment. In your Convex project, run:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex env --prod set CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL 'https://clerk.<your-domain>.com'
   ```

   Then, run the following command to sync your auth configuration to your Convex production deployment:

   filename: terminal

   ```sh
   npx convex deploy
   ```

## Next steps

Be aware that Convex may require usage of their custom hooks and methods rather than Clerk's, such as using Convex's `useConvexAuth()` hook instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook in some cases. For more information on how to use Convex with Clerk, see the [Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk).
