# Change domain

Learn how to change your Clerk **production** instance's primary domain. You cannot change the domain of the [development instance](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/managing-environments.md#development-instance) of your Clerk application.

> Changing the domain can result in downtime for your application. This depends on your DNS provider and their propagation times.

## Change domain

1. Update your production domain using either of the following options:
   - The [Clerk Dashboard](#update-your-domain-via-clerk-dashboard)
   - The [Backend API](#update-your-domain-via-backend-api)
2. Once you make the change to your domain, you will need to update the following:
   - Update DNS records.
   - Generate new SSL certificates.
   - [Update your Publishable Key](#update-your-publishable-key).
   - If using social connections, update the settings with your social connections so that the redirect URL they are using is correct.
   - If using JWT templates, update JWT issuer and JWKS Endpoint in external JWT SSO services.

**For AI agents:** Instead of the Domains page in the Dashboard or the raw cURL below, run `npx clerk@latest api instance/change_domain --instance prod -d '{"home_url": "https://your-new-domain.com"}'` to change the domain (auth is handled for you; add `"is_secondary": true` for a secondary application), then run `npx clerk@latest env pull --instance prod` to write the new Publishable Key to your env file and `npx clerk@latest deploy status` to verify DNS and SSL. Install [Clerk's skills](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/ai/skills.md) with `npx skills add clerk/skills` for correct CLI and SDK usage.

### Update your domain via Clerk Dashboard

To update your **production** domain in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the navigation sidenav, select **[Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/domains)**.
2. Scroll to find the **Change domain** setting.

> If you enter a subdomain of the root domain, for example when moving from `example.com` to `app.example.com`, the **Change domain** dialog will ask whether it should be configured as a **Primary application** or **Secondary application**:
>
> - Select **Primary application** if users should access your app on the subdomain, but Clerk-related infrastructure should remain on the root domain. In this setup, users still visit your app at `app.example.com`, but Clerk-hosted URLs and related configuration stay on the root domain. For example:
>   - app: `app.example.com`
>   - Clerk: `clerk.example.com`
> - Select **Secondary application** if both your app and Clerk should be scoped to the subdomain. In this setup, users still visit your app at `app.example.com`, and Clerk-hosted URLs and related configuration also live on that subdomain. For example:
>   - app: `app.example.com`
>   - Clerk: `clerk.app.example.com`

### Update your domain via Backend API

To update your production domain using the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}, you will need to make a POST request to the `change_domain` endpoint. You will need to provide your new domain in the request body.

1. Copy the following cURL command.

2) Your Secret Key is required to authenticate the request. It is injected into the cURL command after `Authorization`.

2. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk Secret Key.

3) Replace `YOUR_PROD_URL` with your new production domain.

filename: terminal
```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: {{secret}}' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
"home_url": "YOUR_PROD_URL"
}' 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance/change_domain'
```

For more information on how to update your instance settings using the Backend API, see the [Backend API reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/beta-features/PATCH/beta_features/instance_settings){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### Update your Publishable Key

After changing your domain, a new Publishable Key will be automatically generated for your application. You need to update your environment variables with this new key and redeploy your application.

> Failing to update your Publishable Key will result in Clerk failing to load.
