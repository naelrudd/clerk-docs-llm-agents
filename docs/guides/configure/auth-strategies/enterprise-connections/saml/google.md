Clerk supports [Enterprise SSO](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview.md) via the SAML protocol, enabling you to create authentication strategies for an Identity Provider (IdP).

When you configure a SAML connection with Google Workspace as your IdP, your users can sign up and sign in to your application with their Google account. In this guide, **you** configure the connection in the Clerk Dashboard, while **the customer** (whoever manages the Google Admin Console) configures it on the Google side.

> This guide requires coordination between you and your customers' IT administrators. If you're creating an enterprise connection **for an Organization**, you can allow your customers' IT admins to configure SSO themselves. See the [guide on self-serve SSO](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/self-serve-sso.md) for more information.

1. ## Create a Google Workspace SAML connection in Clerk

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
   2. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains or organizations**.
   3. Under **SAML**, select **Google Workspace**.
   4. Enter the **Domain**. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an **Organization**.
   5. Enter the **Name**. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.
   6. Select **Add connection**. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page.
   7. In the **Service Provider Configuration** section, save the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID** values somewhere secure. You'll need to give these to the customer so they can configure their Google Workspace application.
2. ## Configure SAML application

   Now the customer's Google Workspace application needs to be configured with the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID** from Clerk.

   To get you started, you can use the following email template with detailed instructions. Remember to share the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID**:

   Here are the instructions for setting up SAML SSO with Google Workspace:

   **Step 1: Create a custom SAML app**

   1. Navigate to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/) and sign in.
   2. In the navigation sidenav, under **Apps**, select **Web and mobile apps**.
   3. Select **Add app**, then select **Add custom SAML app**.
   4. In the **App details** section, enter an **App name**, then select **Continue**.

   **Step 2: Share the identity provider details**

   1. On the **Google Identity Provider details** page, under **Option 1: Download IdP metadata**, select **Download Metadata** and reply with the file. (Alternatively, under **Option 2**, copy the **SSO URL** and **Entity ID** and download the **Certificate**.)
   2. Select **Continue**.

   **Step 3: Enter the service provider details**

   1. Paste the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID** values provided to you into their respective fields.
   2. Under the **Name ID** section, set the **Name ID format** to **EMAIL**.
   3. Select **Continue**.

   **Step 4: Map attributes**

   Under the **Attributes** section, select **Add mapping** and map the following. Only **Primary email** is required:

   | Google Directory attribute | App attribute |
   | -------------------------- | ------------- |
   | Primary email              | `email`       |
   | First name                 | `firstName`   |
   | Last name                  | `lastName`    |

   Select **Finish**.

   **Step 5: Turn on the app**

   1. In the **User access** section, select **ON for everyone**.
   2. Select **Save**.
3. ## Add the IdP configuration in Clerk

   Once the customer has shared their Google Workspace details, add them to the connection. There are two options:

   - **Metadata configuration** (recommended) - Use the metadata file the customer downloaded from Google. This is quicker than manually inputting the configuration settings.
   - **Custom configuration** - Manually input the configuration settings.
4. ### Metadata configuration

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, open the connection and, in the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, select **Upload file**.
   2. Upload the metadata file that the customer shared.
5. ### Custom configuration

   If you're configuring the connection manually, fill in these three fields in the Clerk Dashboard:

   - **SSO URL** - Your IdP's URL that Clerk will redirect your users to so that they can authenticate.
   - **Entity ID** - The unique identifier of your IdP application.
   - **Certificate** - The certificate needed for Clerk to securely connect to your IdP.

   1. In the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, select **Use manual configuration**.
   2. Fill in the **SSO URL** and **Entity ID**, and upload the **Certificate** that the customer shared. Select **Save**.
6. ## Map IdP claims to Clerk fields

   Clerk automatically maps the standard SAML claims (email, first name, and last name) to the [User](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/objects/user.md) object. To review them, open the connection's **SSO** tab and find the **Common attributes** section under **Attribute mapping**.

   To map a claim that has no standard Clerk field, store it in the user's `publicMetadata`. The approach depends on whether the connection also uses [Directory Sync](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/directory-sync.md):

   - **SSO only:** In the IdP, prefix the claim name with `public_metadata_`. For example, mapping a phone number to `public_metadata_phone_number` stores it under `phone_number` in `User.publicMetadata`. Some IdPs, such as Microsoft Entra, send claims as URLs; map those as plain strings.
   - **SSO with Directory Sync:** Define a custom attribute so the mapping applies to both SSO and SCIM. Define it on the connection's **Overview** tab (in the **Identity provider attributes** section), then map it in the **SSO** tab (in the **Custom attributes** section of the **Attribute mapping** section). Refer to the [guide on custom attribute mapping](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/custom-attribute-mapping.md). While Directory Sync is enabled, SCIM is the only source for these values and overrides SSO.

   Learn more about [accessing user metadata from the API](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/users/extending.md).
7. ## Enable the connection in Clerk

   You have configured the SAML connection. Once enabled, all users with email addresses ending in the domain will be redirected to your identity provider at sign-up and sign-in.

   > If the SAML configuration in Clerk or your identity provider has an error, existing users with matching email domains will be **unable to sign in** once the connection is enabled. We recommend coordinating with your counterpart to test the connection at an off-peak time.

   To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

   1. Navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page and select the connection.
   2. At the top of the page, toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.
