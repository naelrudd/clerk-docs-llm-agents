Clerk supports [Enterprise SSO](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview.md) via the SAML protocol, enabling you to create authentication strategies for an Identity Provider (IdP).

When you configure a SAML connection with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly [Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) as your IdP, your users can sign up and sign in to your application with their Microsoft account. In this guide, **you** configure the connection in the Clerk Dashboard, while **the customer** (whoever manages the Microsoft Entra ID application) configures it on the Microsoft side.

> This guide requires coordination between you and your customers' IT administrators. If you're creating an enterprise connection **for an Organization**, you can allow your customers' IT admins to configure SSO themselves. See the [guide on self-serve SSO](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/self-serve-sso.md) for more information.

1. ## Create a Microsoft Entra ID SAML connection in Clerk

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
   2. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains or organizations**.
   3. Under **SAML**, select **Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly AD)**.
   4. Enter the **Domain**. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an **Organization**.
   5. Enter the **Name**. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.
   6. Select **Add connection**. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page. Note that the connection is disabled by default.
   7. In the **Service Provider Configuration** section, save the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** and **Identifier (Entity ID)** values somewhere secure. You'll need to give these to the customer so they can configure their Microsoft Entra ID application.
2. ## Configure SAML application

   Now that the enterprise connection is configured in Clerk and the **Reply URL** and **Identifier** are known, the customer's Microsoft application needs to be configured. At a high level, the process is:

   - Create a new enterprise application in Microsoft Azure and assign users or groups.
   - Add the **Reply URL** and **Identifier** from Clerk to the application's SAML configuration.
   - Configure the attribute claims.
   - Share the application's **App Federation Metadata URL**.

   To get you started, you can use the following email template with detailed instructions. Remember to share the **Reply URL** and **Identifier (Entity ID)**:

   Here are the instructions for setting up SAML SSO with Microsoft Entra ID:

   **Step 1: Create a new enterprise application**

   1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and go to **Enterprise applications**.
   2. Select **New application**, then **Create your own application**.
   3. In the modal that opens, enter your application name, select **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**, then select **Create**.
   4. In the **Getting Started** section, select **Assign users and groups**. (For group options, see [Microsoft's docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal?pivots=portal).)
   5. Select **Add user/group**, choose the users or groups to assign, then select **Assign**.

   **Step 2: Add your service provider details**

   1. In the side navigation, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **Single sign-on**.
   2. In the **Select a single sign-on method** section, select **SAML**.
   3. Find the **Basic SAML Configuration** section and select **Edit**.
   4. Copy the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** values provided to you into their respective fields.
   5. Select **Save**, then close the panel.

   **Step 3: Configure attributes and claims**

   Your SAML response must include the following attributes:

   | Attribute     | Required | Claim name                                                           | Value            |
   | ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
   | Email address | ✅        | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` | `user.mail`      |
   | First name    | ❌        | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname`    | `user.givenname` |
   | Last name     | ❌        | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname`      | `user.surname`   |

   These are usually the defaults, but it's worth confirming, since many SAML errors come from incorrect attribute mappings. On the **SAML-based Sign-on** page, find the **Attributes & Claims** section, select **Edit**, and verify the attributes above are present.

   **Step 4: Share the application's metadata URL**

   On the **SAML-based Sign-on** page, find the **SAML Certificates** section, copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**, and reply to this email with it.
3. ## Add App Federation Metadata URL in the Clerk Dashboard

   After following the instructions in the email, your customer should have sent you the Microsoft app's **App Federation Metadata URL**. Now, you're going to add it to the Clerk connection, completing the SAML connection configuration.

   1. Navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
   2. Select the SAML connection.
   3. In the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, under **App Federation Metadata Url**, paste the **App Federation Metadata URL**.
   4. Select **Fetch & save**. Keep the page open for the next step.
4. ## Map IdP claims to Clerk fields

   Clerk automatically maps the standard SAML claims (email, first name, and last name) to the [User](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/objects/user.md) object. To review them, open the connection's **SSO** tab and find the **Common attributes** section under **Attribute mapping**.

   To map a claim that has no standard Clerk field, store it in the user's `publicMetadata`. The approach depends on whether the connection also uses [Directory Sync](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/directory-sync.md):

   - **SSO only:** In the IdP, prefix the claim name with `public_metadata_`. For example, mapping a phone number to `public_metadata_phone_number` stores it under `phone_number` in `User.publicMetadata`. Some IdPs, such as Microsoft Entra, send claims as URLs; map those as plain strings.
   - **SSO with Directory Sync:** Define a custom attribute so the mapping applies to both SSO and SCIM. Define it on the connection's **Overview** tab (in the **Identity provider attributes** section), then map it in the **SSO** tab (in the **Custom attributes** section of the **Attribute mapping** section). Refer to the [guide on custom attribute mapping](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/custom-attribute-mapping.md). While Directory Sync is enabled, SCIM is the only source for these values and overrides SSO.

   Learn more about [accessing user metadata from the API](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/users/extending.md).
5. ## Enable the connection in Clerk

   You have configured the SAML connection. Once enabled, all users with email addresses ending in the domain will be redirected to your identity provider at sign-up and sign-in.

   > If the SAML configuration in Clerk or your identity provider has an error, existing users with matching email domains will be **unable to sign in** once the connection is enabled. We recommend coordinating with your counterpart to test the connection at an off-peak time.

   To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

   1. Navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page and select the connection.
   2. At the top of the page, toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.
