# Check Roles and Permissions with Authorization Checks

Authorization checks are checks you perform in your code to determine the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary Permissions to perform specific actions or access certain content. These checks are essential for protecting sensitive data, gating premium features, and ensuring users stay within their allowed scope of access.

Within Organizations, authorization checks can be performed by checking a user's Roles or Custom Permissions. Roles like `org:admin` determine a user's level of access within an Organization, while Custom Permissions like `org:invoices:create` provide fine-grained control over specific features and actions.

## Examples

You can protect content and even entire routes based on Organization membership, Roles, and Permissions by performing authorization checks.

In the following example, the page is restricted to authenticated users, users who have the `org:admin` Role, and users who belong to the `Acme Corp` Organization. It uses the [`has()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object.md?sdk=tanstack-react-start#has) helper to perform the authorization check for the `org:admin` Role.

**Server-side**

filename: src/routes/protected.tsx
```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { clerkClient, auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'

const authStateFn = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  // Use `auth()` to access the `Auth` object
  // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object
  const { isAuthenticated, orgId, has } = await auth()
  const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

  // Check if the user is authenticated
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // This might error if you're redirecting to a path that doesn't exist yet
    // You can create a sign-in route to handle this
    // See https://clerk.com/docs/tanstack-react-start/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page
    throw redirect({
      to: '/sign-in/$',
    })
  }

  // Check if there is an Active Organization
  if (!orgId) return { error: 'Set an Active Organization to access this page.' }

  // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
  if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) return { error: 'You must be an admin to access this page.' }

  // Use the `getOrganization()` method to get the Backend `Organization` object
  const organization = await clerkClient().organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })

  // Check if Organization name matches (e.g., 'Acme Corp')
  if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {
    return {
      error: `This page is only accessible in the ${requiredOrgName} Organization. Switch to the ${requiredOrgName} Organization to access this page.`,
    }
  }

  return { organizationName: organization.name }
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/protected')({
  component: Protected,
  beforeLoad: () => authStateFn(),
  loader: async ({ context }) => context,
})

function Protected() {
  const state = Route.useLoaderData()

  if ('error' in state) return <p>{state.error}</p>

  return (
    <p>
      You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
      <strong>{state.organizationName}</strong> Organization.
    </p>
  )
}
```

**Client-side**

filename: src/routes/protected.tsx
```tsx
import { useAuth, useOrganization } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/protected')({
  component: Protected,
})

function Protected() {
  // The `useAuth()` hook gives you access to properties like `isSignedIn` and `has()`
  const { isSignedIn, has } = useAuth()
  const { organization } = useOrganization()
  const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

  // Check if the user is authenticated
  if (!isSignedIn) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>

  // Check if there is an Active Organization
  if (!organization) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

  // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
  if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>

  // Check if Organization name matches (e.g., 'Acme Corp')
  if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName)
    return (
      <p>
        This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization. Switch
        to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
      </p>
    )

  return (
    <p>
      You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
      <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
    </p>
  )
}
```

When a user isn't in the required Organization, render an [<OrganizationSwitcher />](https://clerk.com/docs/tanstack-react-start/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher.md) alongside the message to let them switch to the required Organization.
