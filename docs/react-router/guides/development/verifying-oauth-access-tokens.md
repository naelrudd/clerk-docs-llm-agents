# Verify OAuth access tokens in your React Router application with Clerk

When building a resource server that needs to accept and verify OAuth access tokens issued by Clerk, it's crucial to verify these tokens on your backend to ensure the request is coming from an authenticated client.

> This guide assumes you've configured [clerkMiddleware()](https://clerk.com/docs/react-router/reference/react-router/clerk-middleware.md) in your React Router application. The `getAuth()` helper requires Clerk Middleware to be configured before it can read request authentication state.

Clerk's React Router SDK provides a built-in [getAuth()](https://clerk.com/docs/react-router/reference/react-router/get-auth.md) function that supports token validation via the `acceptsToken` parameter. This lets you specify which type(s) of token your loader or action should accept in your React Router application.

By default, `acceptsToken` is set to `session_token`, which means OAuth tokens will **not** be accepted unless explicitly configured. You can pass either a **single token type** or an **array of token types** to `acceptsToken`. To learn more about the supported token types, see the [getAuth() parameters documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/react-router/reference/react-router/get-auth.md#parameters).

Below are two examples of verifying OAuth access tokens in a React Router route module using Clerk's SDK:

## Example 1: Accepting a single token type

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter is set to only accept `oauth_token`s.

- If the token is invalid or missing, `getAuth()` will return `false` for `isAuthenticated`, and the request will be rejected with a `401` response.
- If the token is valid, `userId` (the user who authorized the OAuth application) is returned along with the token's granted `scopes` for use in the application logic.

filename: app/routes/api.example.ts
```ts
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/react-router/server'
import type { Route } from './+types/api.example'

export async function loader(args: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const authObject = await getAuth(args, {
    acceptsToken: 'oauth_token',
  })

  // If isAuthenticated is false, the token is invalid
  if (!authObject.isAuthenticated) {
    throw new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  const { userId, scopes } = authObject

  return Response.json({ userId, scopes })
}
```

## Example 2: Accepting multiple token types

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter allows both `session_token`s and `oauth_token`s.

- If the token is invalid or missing, `getAuth()` will return `false` for `isAuthenticated`. Check `isAuthenticated` before reading the other properties, like `userId`.
- If the token is an `oauth_token`, the code checks that it includes the required `'profile'` scope. If not, the request is rejected with a `401` response.
- If the token is valid and the required scope is present, `isAuthenticated` is `true` and `userId` is returned. Because the `'profile'` scope grants access to the user's identity, this example uses the `userId` to fetch and return the user's profile data.

filename: app/routes/api.example.ts
```ts
import { getAuth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/react-router/server'
import type { Route } from './+types/api.example'

export async function action(args: Route.ActionArgs) {
  // Accept both session_token and oauth_token types
  const authObject = await getAuth(args, {
    acceptsToken: ['session_token', 'oauth_token'],
  })

  // If isAuthenticated is false, the token is invalid
  if (!authObject.isAuthenticated) {
    throw new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  // Check if the token is an oauth_token and if it doesn't have the required scope
  if (authObject.tokenType === 'oauth_token' && !authObject.scopes.includes('profile')) {
    throw new Response('OAuth token missing the "profile" scope', { status: 401 })
  }

  // The 'profile' scope grants access to the user's identity,
  // so fetch and return the authenticated user's profile data
  const user = await clerkClient(args).users.getUser(authObject.userId)

  return Response.json({ id: user.id, firstName: user.firstName, lastName: user.lastName })
}
```
