# <RedirectToSignUp />

The `<RedirectToSignUp />` component will navigate to the sign up URL which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

## Example

filename: app/routes/home.tsx
```tsx
import { Show, RedirectToSignUp, UserButton } from '@clerk/react-router'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Show when="signed-in">
        <UserButton />
      </Show>
      <Show when="signed-out">
        <RedirectToSignUp />
      </Show>
    </>
  )
}
```
